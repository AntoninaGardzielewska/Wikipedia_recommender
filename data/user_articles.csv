September 1979 1 was an English Muggle born 3 witch born to Mr and Mrs Granger At the age of eleven she learned about her magical nature and was accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Hermione began attending Hogwarts in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House She possessed a brilliant academic mind and proved to be a gifted student in almost every subject that she studied to the point where she was nearly made a Ravenclaw by the Sorting Hat Hermione first met her future best friends Harry Potter and Ron Weasley aboard the Hogwarts Express and initially they found her unfriendly and somewhat of an insufferable know it all an impression reinforced by her constant correct answers and eagerness to please the professors However she stepped in to take the blame from the boys after they had saved her from a troll on Hallowe en in 1991 surprising them in a grateful way which led to them quickly becoming friends She later played a crucial role in protecting the Philosopher s Stone from Voldemort In her second year Hermione had a key role in the discovery of the Chamber of Secrets before falling victim to the Basilisk unleashed upon Hogwarts following the opening of the Chamber However she recovered from the petrification under the care of Madam Pomfrey with Professor Sprout s Mandrake Restorative Draught The next year Hermione was granted permission to use a Time Turner from the Ministry of Magic to facilitate her volition to study far more subjects than were possible without time travel though she and Harry later used it to rescue Sirius Black from the Dementor s Kiss and Buckbeak the hippogriff from execution During her fourth year Hermione became an advocate for the better treatment of house elves forming the association S P E W and helped in Harry s preparation for the Triwizard Tournament In her fifth year Hermione was the driving force behind the creation of Dumbledore s Army and fought alongside fellow D A members in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries In her sixth year Hermione continued her role as Prefect and fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower Hermione played a significant role in many other battles of the Second Wizarding War as well In 1997 she fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters alongside the Order of the Phoenix Hermione and Ron decided not to return to Hogwarts for their final year of studies instead choosing to accompany Harry on his quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort s Horcruxes a quest in which several of her actions were essential She destroyed Hufflepuff s Cup a Horcrux with Ron using a Basilisk fang found in the Chamber of Secrets Hermione then fought in the Battle of Hogwarts helping in the defeat of the Death Eater who tortured her Bellatrix Lestrange Following the Second Wizarding War Hermione went back to Hogwarts to complete her education She later found employment with the Ministry of Magic furthering the cause for the better treatment of house elves Afterward she was promoted to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement where she dedicated herself to eradicating old laws that were biased in favour of pure bloods Hermione eventually married Ron Weasley and together they had two children Rose and Hugo She became the godmother of Harry and Ginny Potter s eldest son James By the year 2019 Hermione had become the thirty sixth Minister for Magic A young Hermione with her parents Hermione Granger was born to Mr and Mrs Granger both dentists on 19 September 1979 She was their only child and daughter 29 The couple chose a nice unusual first name for her because they wanted to establish how educated and intelligent they were while also knowing that she would be unique and special 30 Mr and Mrs Granger were a bit bemused by the oddities displayed by their daughter but they were proud and accepting of her nonetheless The couple gave Hermione a bedroom on the first floor of their house 31 and they lived happily for many years A young Hermione before starting Hogwarts Upon turning eleven Hermione was happily surprised to learn that she was a witch and was therefore invited to attend Hogwarts She eagerly accepted and took to studying magic even before she began her first year at Hogwarts in the September of 1991 learning all the set spell books by heart and even managing to perform a few spells at home successfully In addition to the texts set by the school Hermione brought with her several other books for reference and to further her understanding of the wizarding world 3 to the point that she had looked at books and had more knowledge of the wizarding world than some of her pure blood and half blood classmates Hermione s love of books Hermione enjoyed her years as a pupil at Hogwarts and took assignments classes and school rules very seriously She was often described as brilliant to the point of being said to be the brightest witch of her age Her favourite subject was initially Charms and later Arithmancy Given her keen mind some students such as Terry Boot wondered why Hermione was Sorted into Gryffindor rather than Ravenclaw and she admitted that the Sorting Hat did consider putting her in Ravenclaw It is likely that the Sorting Hat ultimately put her in Gryffindor after stalling for about 4 minutes because Hermione chose to be in it just like Harry chose to not be in Slytherin this is reinforced by how on the train earlier she stated that Gryffindor sounds by far the best She later proved her rightful place in Gryffindor with her steadfast bravery and loyalty to her friends Hogwarts and Dumbledore s Army After being Sorted into Gryffindor Hermione shared a dormitory with Lavender Brown Parvati Patil Fay Dunbar and an unnamed ginger haired girl 32 In spite of always wanting to follow the school rules after Hermione became friends with Harry and Ron she would disobey the rules along with them in order to successfully complete their group affairs For example she went with Ron and Harry into the third floor corridor in their first year which students were temporarily forbidden from entering in order to save the Philosopher s Stone she assisted in creating the Polyjuice Potion in their second year and although Harry was the one who taught Dumbledore s Army in their fifth year she was the one who came up with the idea The trio meeting for the first time aboard the Hogwarts Express Hermione was a couple of weeks away from turning twelve when she boarded the Hogwarts Express in 1991 where she met Harry Potter and Ron Weasley while helping Neville Longbottom find his pet toad Trevor Hermione demonstrated knowledge and talent with magic beyond most of those her age despite having only recently discovered that she was a witch She wished to be a Gryffindor or a Ravenclaw and her wish was granted considering she did get sorted into Gryffindor Hermione being sorted by the Sorting Hat Hermione soon proved to be the best in all her classes eager to please the professors and to help others learn albeit in a bossy way that made it difficult for her to make friends Although she was a know it all Hermione did often help Neville Longbottom who struggled in most classes other than Herbology 3 Hermione strictly followed all school rules and tried to prevent other students from breaking rules and getting into trouble On one night she followed Harry and Ron as they were leaving Gryffindor Tower to duel Draco Malfoy They were chased by Argus Filch acting on a tipoff by Malfoy into the third floor corridor forbidden to students where they came face to face with Fluffy a three headed dog belonging to Hagrid Later on she argued that her spying was to their benefit when she pointed out the dog had been standing on a trapdoor which neither Harry nor Ron had noticed 3 The mountain troll entering the bathroom that Hermione s in during the Hallowe en feast The friendship between Harry Ron and Hermione was solidified when on Hallowe en in 1991 the three were forced to confront a mountain troll which had been secretly let into the school by Professor Quirinus Quirrell Unaware that a troll was on the loose in the school Hermione had spent that day crying in the girls bathroom after overhearing Ron making unkind comments about her The troll made its way into the bathroom she was in and Harry and Ron came to her rescue saving her When Professors Minerva McGonagall Severus Snape and Quirinus Quirrell arrived at the scene Hermione covered for the boys claiming she was fighting the troll because she had thought that she could manage having read a great deal about them and that Ron and Harry had merely come to help her escape From then on the three students reconciled and were best friends and spent large amounts of time together 3 Hermione setting Snape s robes on fire during a Quidditch match The incident with the troll was by no means her only adventure in that first year During the first Quidditch match Hermione set Professor Snape s robes on fire when she thought he was jinxing Harry s broom In the spring of 1992 Hagrid now a friend of Hermione s through Harry managed to procure a Dragon egg the unlicensed possession of which was illegal The three children secretly helped Hagrid care for the beast which he d named Norbert When the dragon was discovered she and Harry smuggled it out of the school to some friends of Ron s elder brother Charlie Weasley who worked as a dragon tamer On their way back to the dormitories they were caught by Argus Filch who escorted them to Professor Minerva McGonagall Along with Neville Longbottom and Draco Malfoy they received detention and had fifty points deducted each from their respective houses 3 Harry Ron and Hermione running into Fluffy in the third floor corridor After their run in with Fluffy Harry deduced that whatever Hagrid had retrieved from Gringotts was beneath the trapdoor Hagrid let it slip that What s under that trapdoor is strictly between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel After much research turned up nothing Harry was given a Dumbledore Chocolate Frog Card by Neville which mentions Dumbledore s work in Alchemy with Flamel This led Hermione to look at a large book on Alchemy which she had borrowed from the library for a bit of light reading After consulting the book she realised that Fluffy was guarding the Philosopher s Stone 3 The trio standing as a unified front during the human chess match Fearing that Lord Voldemort would return if he stole the stone and believing that Snape was acting as a double agent and attempting to steal it Harry decided to steal it first When he told Hermione that he could go on alone she rebuffed him After the trio passed Fluffy it was Hermione who freed Ron from a patch of Devil s Snare he had dropped into by conjuring Bluebell Flames She later got herself and Harry through a challenge involving a potion riddle in order to obtain the right potion between many of them Hermione used her logic to figure out the riddle and let Harry go forward without her as there was only enough potion for one person 3 Later at the Farewell Feast in the Great Hall Hermione Harry Ron and Neville were all awarded extra House points for bravery and heroism allowing Gryffindor to win the House Cup Hermione earned fifty points for Gryffindor by correctly solving Professor Snape s potion riddle 3 Before she started her second year Hermione wrote several letters to Harry at Privet Drive all of which were intercepted by Dobby as the house elf wanted Harry to believe that his friends had forgotten him in order to prevent his return to Hogwarts She and her parents also accompanied Harry and the Weasley family to Diagon Alley to shop for school supplies 4 Draco Malfoy calling Hermione the derogatory slur Mudblood It was during her second school year that Hermione first encountered the prejudice and hatred surrounding her blood status when Draco Malfoy called her a filthy little Mudblood after she told him off for insulting the Gryffindor Quidditch team Hermione had never heard the highly offensive term but looking around at everyone around her it was an obvious fact Fred and George Weasley lunged at him and Ron even tried to hex him but it backfired as his wand had been damaged To help Hermione feel better about the incident Hagrid urged her not to think about it pointing out that she was a talented witch regardless of what bigoted people said about her Muggle born status 4 Harry and Ron were surprised and Ron annoyed by Hermione s obvious crush on Gilderoy Lockhart who became that year s Defence Against the Dark Arts professor She scored full marks on the first quiz in his class which consisted entirely of questions pertaining to Lockhart s books including a question regarding his favourite colour lilac that most of the class had answered incorrectly In fact she went as far as to doodle hearts on her DADA assignments not knowing until later that he was in reality a self obsessed fraud 4 The writing on the wall and the Petrified form of Mrs Norris On Hallowe en 1992 Hermione attended Nearly Headless Nick s Deathday Party with Harry and Ron Whilst heading back upstairs she followed Harry in a detour after he claimed to be hearing voices They discovered the caretaker s cat Mrs Norris petrified and the walls vandalised Hermione began spending all her free time in the Hogwarts Library after she saw the writing on the corridor walls which had said that the Chamber of Secrets had been re opened Despite hoping to read about the legend she could not as all the books had been previously checked out 4 Hermione asking Professor Binns about the Chamber of Secrets Hermione shocked everyone when she actually interrupted Professor Binns during a History of Magic class asking about the Chamber of Secrets This was the only known time when a student had asked the boring professor a question and the class was interested in what he had to say Professor Binns had stated that Salazar Slytherin had hidden a chamber which consisted of a horrible monster It had been unleashed before once by an Heir of Slytherin petrifying many Muggle born and had also killed a Ravenclaw girl named Myrtle Warren who began haunting the girls lavatory and became known as Moaning Myrtle Slytherin a pure blood loyalist was against Muggle born children being allowed to attend Hogwarts but he was outnumbered by the other founders and Muggle borns like Hermione were permitted as students Slytherin fled the school but rumours spread that he had built a hidden chamber it was said that the school had been searched many times but no such chamber had been found 4 Hermione brewing Polyjuice Potion used by the trio in an attempt to gain information from Draco Malfoy When Harry proposed the theory that Draco Malfoy was the Heir of Slytherin Hermione and Ron agreed Hermione suggested that they brew Polyjuice Potion and temporarily transform themselves into Slytherin students in an attempt to find out the truth She went even further by daring to check Moste Potente Potions out of the library using a note from Professor Lockhart who had no idea what the book was in the desire to research the potion The book was in the Restricted Section and therefore unavailable to younger students without permission from a teacher She hoped that they would be able to obtain a viable confession from Malfoy if he was unaware he was being interrogated She brewed the potion in Moaning Myrtle s bathroom as no one used it due to Myrtle herself being highly irritating She also risked serious consequences when she stole potion ingredients from Professor Snape s personal cupboards that were needed for the difficult potion which took a month to brew 4 The trio discuss possible theories behind Tom Riddle s mysterious diary Unfortunately Hermione was unable to join Harry and Ron in the ruse with Polyjuice Potion because the hair she obtained from Slytherin Millicent Bulstrode during their scuffle in the Duelling Club was actually the hair of Bulstrode s cat Hermione grew fur and a tail and remained in the Hospital Wing for weeks as she did not transform back when the normal duration of effectiveness one hour was up Harry and Ron however were able to use the potion she brewed to transform into Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe respectively They entered the Slytherin common room and through conversation with Draco Malfoy realised that he was not the Heir of Slytherin and was not involved in the opening of the Chamber after all 4 Meanwhile Hermione continued to complete her school work from her bed in the Hospital Wing while she recovered 33 A Petrified Hermione in the Hospital Wing Months after her recovery from the Polyjuice complication Hermione suffered another accident Drawing the connection between Harry hearing voices in the walls and him being a Parselmouth she came to the conclusion that the creature attacking students must be a Basilisk and rushed to the library to conduct further research On her way back from the library she warned the first person she saw Penelope Clearwater and advised her to look around corners with a mirror before going anywhere It saved both their lives because they were both petrified when they spotted the Basilisk s eyes through the mirror instead of dying immediately as they would have done if they d looked straight into its eyes 4 Though she was petrified for the rest of the school year Hermione was still able to assist Harry and Ron for she had torn out the page on Basilisks and scribbled on it pipes referencing the manner in which the creature had moved around the school undetected Harry and Ron found it clenched in her hand when they were finally allowed to visit her in the Hospital Wing Using this note and other information they had gathered Harry and Ron were able to successfully put an end to Lord Voldemort s plans to resurrect his body through his memory stored in an old school diary 4 A fully recovered Hermione Hermione was later cured with a Mandrake Restorative Draught created by Professor Sprout Upon arriving at the Great Hall she was immediately greeted by Nearly Headless Nick After hugging Harry she exchanged an awkward greeting with Ron Hermione was disappointed to learn that as a special treat for the school Professor Dumbledore cancelled the students end of year exams but she was intensely proud that her friends had solved the mystery 4 That summer Hermione went on holiday to France with her parents 34 Hermione adopting Crookshanks from the Magical Menagerie Just before she began the 1993 1994 school year while visiting Diagon Alley with Harry and the Weasley family Hermione met and adopted a ginger part Kneazle cat named Crookshanks from the Magical Menagerie However her new bond with her cat caused friction with Ron and his pet rat Scabbers as Crookshanks was always trying to catch the rat Also at the beginning of this school year Hermione obtained a Time Turner from Professor McGonagall so she could double up on classes though this was kept secret from everyone even Harry and Ron McGonagall confiscating Harry s Firebolt after Hermione reported it When Harry received a Firebolt for Christmas with no note Hermione reported it to Professor McGonagall thinking it was sent by Sirius Black whom everyone believed to be a dangerous murderer who was after Harry His broom was taken away to be inspected which caused a temporary rift between the two friends There was a further social strain for Hermione when Ron accused Crookshanks of eating Scabbers who had disappeared Hermione poured herself into defending Buckbeak the hippogriff on trial before the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures for attacking Draco Malfoy during a Care of Magical Creatures class Once the trio reconciled after Hagrid told Harry and Ron how disappointed he was when they selfishly put the Firebolt and Scabbers over their friendship with Hermione they apologised Their initial attempt to save Buckbeak failed as Lucius Malfoy frightened the Committee into deciding that the creature would be executed Hermione was extremely upset by this news and grew furious to the point of slapping Draco Malfoy when he dared to mock Hagrid for his tears and being upset over Buckbeak s fate That year Hermione was among the students who found Remus Lupin to be the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher they have ever had She cleverly deduced that Professor Lupin was a werewolf based on his Boggart taking the form of a full moon the timing of his unexplained absences from class and Professor Snape changing a lesson he took over to the subject of werewolves even though it wasn t due on the syllabus for weeks However she didn t expose Lupin presumably because she believed he was a good teacher and didn t agree with the prejudice many hold against werewolves Trelawney telling Hermione that she does not possess the Second Sight Divination on the other hand turned out to be a subject Hermione had no respect or interest in She considered it a woolly subject and mocked it to Harry and Ron She also considered it less interesting then the subject of Ancient Runes She also believed that Divination was an imprecise branch of magic an opinion she and Professor McGonagall shared 34 She soon dropped the subject after Professor Sybill Trelawney told her that she did not possess the Second Sight Professor Lupin and Sirius Black with the trio before forcing Pettigrew into human form On the day of Buckbeak s execution the trio ventured down to console Hagrid While in his cabin Hermione discovered Scabbers Ron s lost rat Hagrid urged them to leave and they witnessed from a distance what they believed to be Buckbeak s execution Before they could return to their dormitory Scabbers bit Ron and fled While chasing after the rat they were attacked by a black dog which pulled Ron by the leg into a tunnel beneath the Whomping Willow which then attacked them Afterward Hermione and Harry hurried after them eventually arriving in the Shrieking Shack where Sirius Black whose Animagus form was the black dog confronted them They were soon joined by Professor Lupin who was acting strangely and Hermione told Harry and Ron of her belief that he was a werewolf which he then confirmed It was revealed that Sirius had been framed for the betrayal of James and Lily Potter and that the true traitor was Peter Pettigrew who had been hiding from the world as Ron s pet rat Hermione also cast Expelliarmus on Snape when he discovered them knocking him out at which she was horrified Harry Hermione and Sirius being attacked by Dementors at the Black Lake Once it had been decided that Pettigrew would be turned over to the authorities rather than murdered the motley group left the Shrieking Shack When the full moon appeared chaos ensued as Lupin transformed into a werewolf as due to the chaotic turn of events he hadn t taken the Wolfsbane Potion that Professor Snape produced for him monthly in order for him to retain his humanity In the chaos Pettigrew attacked Ron and escaped and Sirius had to transform into his dog form in order to protect Harry Ron and Hermione from the werewolf After Lupin was eventually distracted by a howl from the Forbidden Forest Hermione and Harry rushed to Sirius aid when they heard him moaning but hundreds of Dementors descended on them come to recapture Sirius who quickly fainted and Harry told Hermione to think of something happy and attempt to cast a Patronus as he was trying to himself but she was unable to cast one As Harry conjured an incorporeal Patronus Hermione passed out leaving Harry to fight the Dementors alone Harry held them off for a while but was eventually overwhelmed The Dementors were about to perform the Dementor s Kiss on Harry Hermione and Sirius when a mysterious figure in the distance cast a very powerful Patronus Charm to repel the Dementors Unable to see properly in the resulting blinding light Harry thought he glimpsed his father just before he too lost consciousness Harry and Hermione using the Time Turner Harry and Hermione awoke in the Hospital Wing after being rescued by Severus Snape who conjured stretchers for Hermione Harry and Sirius After realising that Sirius soul was to be destroyed by the Dementor s Kiss and receiving vague though instructive and useful instructions from Dumbledore Hermione used her Time Turner to return herself and Harry to a time earlier in the evening It was a very difficult task and Harry had to be constantly reminded by Hermione to stay concealed as being seen could cause irreparable damage to their timelines Hermione agreed with Harry that it was difficult to watch their problems again but she strictly said that they could do nothing about it as bad things happened to wizards who tried to meddle with their past and future lives Harry and Hermione setting Sirius Black and Buckbeak free The two did however successfully use the opportunity to rescue Sirius and also Buckbeak as it was hinted by Dumbledore that more than one innocent life could be spared that night 34 Whilst waiting she discussed their saviour with Harry and when Harry realised that it was not his father he saw but himself having travelled back in time she claimed that none but a powerful wizard could have conjured a Patronus to drive away that many Dementors As evidenced by her assertion that time travelling was extremely dangerous Hermione took great personal risk to save Sirius and Buckbeak At the end of the year Hermione returned her Time Turner claiming it caused too much trouble and that she would drop a few subjects instead which was a very big surprise to everyone Ron Harry and Hermione after the riot of the 1994 Quidditch World Cup Before her fourth year at Hogwarts Hermione spent much of the summer holidays at The Burrow with Harry and Ron sharing a room with Ginny Weasley With the other Weasleys excluding Molly Weasley they attended the 1994 Quidditch World Cup in August After the game the communal campsite was set upon by Death Eaters Hermione Harry and Ron fled into the woods and witnessed the casting of Morsmordre Initially caught up in the chaos surrounding the effort to catch the caster she took exception to the accusations levelled against Harry and the many wizards treatment of the house elf Winky who had also been at the scene Once at Hogwarts it was revealed to the students that former Auror Alastor Moody who was in fact a polyjuiced Barty Crouch Jnr was to be the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Lupin having left at the end of the previous year due to Snape outing his werewolf status Moody was a hands on professor who believed in a practical approach when it came to defence One of his earliest lessons was on the Unforgivable Curses Hermione and her fellow classmates witnessed the curse s effects on a spider The first meeting of the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare Hermione began a crusade for the liberation of house elves by beginning the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare or what she and the group called S P E W or as Ronald Weasley called it spew having been appalled by Bartemius Crouch s abusive treatment of his house elf Winky This did not earn her any popularity as most believed that house elves enjoy their work indeed even the house elves did not like her campaigning Harry Ron and Neville only reluctantly joined S P E W mostly in order to prevent Hermione from nagging them about it Hagrid as well as Fred and George Weasley refused to join on the grounds that it would upset the house elves Despite this Fred did tell Hermione how to get into the Hogwarts kitchens One morning she along with Harry and Ron visited the kitchens where she spoke to Dobby and Winky Dobby was pleased to see Harry and his friends and proceeded to tell them his struggles as a freed elf The trio visiting the house elves in the Hogwarts kitchen While the trio were within the kitchen it was revealed that Winky was so saddened by the lose of her previous job that she had taken to drinking Butterbeer as a means to get drunk and numb her pain Hermione considered Dobby to be a good example of a free elf and tried to comfort Winky about being sacked by Crouch This did little good however as Winky soon became upset by Hermione s claims that house elves deserved to have holidays and wages Winky was not the only elf bothered by this as the other elves stated that proper house elves would never need such things and to want them is considered very shameful Hermione believed Harry without question when he said he did not enter his name in the Triwizard Tournament After the events surrounding Harry s name coming out of the Goblet of Fire Hermione was the only student who believed Harry s innocence In fact she accepted his story without question Even Ron was suspicious that Harry had cheated in order to gain more glory creating a rift between the two for some time Hermione helped Harry prepare for the first task of the Triwizard Tournament by helping him learn useful spells Some of the spells were Stupefy Impedimenta Accio the Shield Charm and the Four Point Spell She also tried to get Harry and Ron to talk to one another multiple times Hermione unknowingly attracted the interest of Durmstrang Triwizard Champion and Bulgarian International Seeker Viktor Krum He was attracted to her due to her intelligence unconventional beauty and the manner in which she declined to hound him for autographs unlike other girls Krum began following Hermione to the library and other places around Hogwarts including the library This was something that Hermione found very irritating as she couldn t work when surrounded by giggling girls who had taken it upon themselves to follow Krum throughout the castle and the school grounds Krum even bizarrely asked Harry if it was all right for him to pursue Hermione He eventually asked her to attend the Yule Ball with him and she accepted not telling anyone but Ginny Weasley that she was his date Hermione dancing with her date Viktor Krum at the Yule Ball Thus when the pair arrived many were stunned and jealous Hermione wore robes of a floaty periwinkle blue material and her hair in an elegant knot at the back of her head 35 The attention to her appearance was unusual and she received many positive remarks on it Even Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson had nothing negative to say Hermione commented that she had used Sleekeazy s Hair Potion but that it was too much work to use it every day Hermione upset after getting into a row with Ron at the Yule Ball Upon seeing Hermione with Krum Ron was overcome with jealousy Hermione had hoped for Ron to ask her but his invitation was insensitive and at the last minute due to him not being able to find anyone else The two rowed about it in the common room after the ball in which she revealed that he should have asked her properly and not as a last resort but Ron misunderstood the point After that the two were seemingly more polite to each other although more distant for a time and Ron continued to show dislike and distrust towards Krum Hermione inside the Black Lake during the second task Hermione was chosen as a kidnap victim for Krum during the Tournament s second task something that she subsequently endured teasing over She was taken to the bottom of the Black Lake to await rescue from Krum who donned a half shark Transfiguration While in the Black Lake Harry was conflicted and wanted to retrieve her as much as he wanted to retrieve Ron He stated that she was his friend too Krum managed to rescue her and carried her to the surface where he revealed to her later that he never felt this way about any other girl and asked her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer 35 Krum was jealous of Hermione s relationship with Harry Potter thinking that there may have been something romantic between them that went beyond just plain friendship The jealousy was founded based on the lies in the Daily Prophet and Harry was quick to inform Krum of these lies Hermione receiving hate mail from the readers of Witch Weekly in response to Skeeter s article Rita Skeeter a journalist for the Daily Prophet and unregistered Animagus was hiding in beetle form in Hermione s hair during her conversation with Viktor Hermione had previously reprimanded Skeeter for printing horrible lies about Harry and Rubeus Hagrid This angered the journalist who wrote a scathing article on the devious Miss Granger claiming that she was toying with both Harry and Krum s affections and that she had developed a taste for famous wizards Skeeter even went so far to claim that Hermione was possibly brewing love potions In the words of Ron Skeeter was making Hermione out to be a Scarlet Woman a phrase which made Hermione laugh She called Hermione plain in the article in spite of previously reporting Hermione as Harry s stunningly pretty girlfriend by likely twisting and sensationalising the words of Colin Creevey and thus using this as the basis for the article Although Hermione found the lies ridiculous some people believed them and started sending Hermione hate mail including one filled with Bubotuber Pus and even Molly Weasley treated her coldly until Harry corrected her Hermione vowed to get revenge on Skeeter for her libel and wondered how she was getting her information as several things Skeeter knew had only been discussed in private conversations This led her to come to the realisation that Skeeter was an illegal unregistered Animagus who took the form of a beetle to secretly witness confidential exchanges Hermione was present when the Minister for Magic visited Harry in the hospital wing The students were shocked when Harry returned at the end of the third and final task with Cedric Diggory s dead body Hermione was relieved to see Harry when he was brought to the infirmary by Professor Dumbledore She was upset with Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge when he refused to believe Harry and Dumbledore about the truth of Voldemort s return During her time with Harry in the Hospital Wing she noticed Skeeter on a windowsill attempting to eavesdrop and captured her in the process Hermione did not go against Harry s story when she finally heard it sticking by her best friend On the ride home on the Hogwarts Express Hermione happily revealed to Harry and Ron that she uncovered Skeeter s status as an unregistered Animagus and had trapped her in a jar She as an unregistered beetle Animagus that used her tiny size to come onto school grounds and listen to private conversations She was not allowed onto school grounds and Hermione caught her on a windowsill in the hospital wing Hermione also noticed the markings around Rita s antennae were exactly like the foul glasses she wore She kept Skeeter from writing for a year by threatening to expose her to the authorities She single handed drove Skeeter into poverty gaining revenge for the pain caused to Harry and her other friends However with the return of Lord Voldemort and the murder of Cedric Diggory at the end of the school year 35 there were much more serious challenges ahead for Hermione and her friends Hermione along with her friends and school mates attended the Memorial Feast for Cedric Hermione with others in 12 Grimmauld Place preparing to clean Following the death of Cedric Diggory the Ministry of Magic refused to accept Harry and Dumbledore s claims that Lord Voldemort had returned and the Daily Prophet labelled them either liars or nutters However Hermione and Ron believed Harry and defended him against the criticism of doubtful classmates Though occasionally Harry vented his frustration at them the two stuck by him The trio also wanted to become members of the reconvened Order of the Phoenix but were not allowed to because they were underage Hermione helped exterminate 12 Grimmauld Place which served as headquarters for the Order and was immensely relieved when Harry was acquitted of the charge of having used underage magic in the presence of a muggle after him and Dudley Dursley were attacked by a Dementor in Little Whinging Before returning to Hogwarts she and Ron learned that they had been appointed prefects for Gryffindor house to the secret consternation of Harry who couldn t believe Ron had been chosen over him She took her position very seriously Once the school year began Hermione resumed some of her activism on behalf of house elves though she was not as intense about S P E W as she had been the previous year The trio and Neville meet Luna Lovegood for the first time She learned how to knit socks and hats for the house elves and hid them in Gryffindor Tower disguising them with crumpled rubbish in an attempt to trick the house elves into accidentally freeing themselves The elves found this attempt insulting and they stopped cleaning the Tower at all Dobby was the only one who enjoyed the gifts took everything Hermione had made and cleaned the Tower by himself a fact which Hermione didn t know Hermione was challenged in more ways than one that year when she met Luna Lovegood whose belief in many things without logical grounds baffled Hermione However the two became friends after accepting one another s differences 32 Hermione practising with Dumbledore s Army in the Room of Requirement Meanwhile it was not long before Hermione realised that the Ministry of Magic had decided to interfere at Hogwarts Dolores Umbridge a cruel falsely sweet Ministry employee with a personality like poisoned honey was appointed as the new professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts and Hermione like Harry and Ron disliked Umbridge for many reasons one of which being that she refused to teach students practical defence focusing only on theory despite their OWLs being later that year With this being the case Hermione decided that Hogwarts needed a competent teacher and together with Harry and Ron founded Dumbledore s Army a secret organisation in which students would gather after classes and be taught practical defensive spells She suggested that Harry be the teacher though he originally thought the idea ridiculous he consented to teach the class The name was suggested by Ginny who recalled the conversation they d had about Fudge s greatest fear being that Dumbledore would form an army of students if the Ministry did not intervene at Hogwarts Hermione conjuring her otter Patronus One of the many advanced spells Hermione learned was the Patronus Charm hers took the corporeal form of an otter 23 Hermione became one of the few people brave enough to call Voldemort by his actual name However Hermione made the mistake of arranging the first meeting to take place in the Hog s Head as opposed to the Three Broomsticks which Sirius appearing in the Gryffindor Common Room fire said would have made it a lot harder for anyone to overhear Willy Widdershins who was in the Hog s Head went to Umbridge who instituted Educational Decree Number Twenty Four to forbid any type of students groups from being formed under her watchful eye The trio and Ginny in St Mungo s after visiting Arthur Weasley Halfway through the year at Hogwarts Harry had a vision of Voldemort s snake Nagini biting Mr Weasley during his task for the Order of the Phoenix Mr Weasley was carried into St Mungo s Hospital where Mrs Weasley screamed at him for trying to stitch his wound instead of healing it with magic Hermione was one of the few who visited him and stayed at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place for a couple of weeks until Mr Weasley was nursed back to health Hermione had managed to convince her parents by telling them that skiing wasn t really her thing and that people who were serious about their exams stayed at Hogwarts and studied The trio in the Gryffindor common room having a discussion about recent events The D A brought Harry into greater contact with Cho Chang After a meeting Harry kissed Cho and when he returned to the Gryffindor Common Room Hermione immediately guessed asking if Cho had cornered him after the meeting When Harry told them that Cho has been crying she explained to Harry and Ron that Cho was having a hard time since Cedric Diggory who she used to go out with was killed by Lord Voldemort Hermione later gave Harry advice on Cho and girls in general In an effort to combat the lies being told about Harry Hermione arranged for an interview during a Hogsmeade visit with Rita Skeeter to be printed in The Quibbler telling his side of the story blackmailing Skeeter into penning it in a sympathetic tone Despite being banned or maybe because it was banned it became the magazine s best selling issue of all time 32 It was Hermione s brilliant spell work that ensured the security of Dumbledore s Army She created coins enchanted with the Protean Charm an advanced spell as a method of communication and jinxed the club s attendance sheet to give any tattler a horrendous rash on the face which would spell out SNEAK in painful boils This is exactly what happened to Marietta Edgecombe a reluctant member of the D A having been brought to the meetings by Cho Shortly before Easter Marietta finally caved under the pressure from her ministry mother who worked in the the Floo Network Office and betrayed the D A to Umbridge When Harry learned that they could not find a counter curse to heal her face he swelled with pride at Hermione s jinxing ability Hermione and Neville Longbottom being held against their will by the Inquisitorial Squad Dobby the house elf learned of this turn of events and rushed to the Room of Requirement to warn Harry and the D A They immediately scattered and most members escaped but Harry was caught by Umbridge and several Slytherin students who were members of the Inquisitorial Squad A search of the room uncovered the parchment that each member of the D A had signed headed Dumbledore s Army Finally having proof that Dumbledore was building an army to challenge the Ministry Umbridge immediately contacted Cornelius Fudge Dumbledore fled the school and Umbridge became Headmistress Hermione was not exposed at that time but later she was brought to Umbridge s office by the some members of the Inquisitorial Squad Late in the fall of that year Hagrid who had been missing for the entirety of the school year returned to Hogwarts Hermione Harry and Ron ventured down to see him immediately even though it was after curfew Hermione was aghast at the injuries Hagrid had sustained and greatly curious as to his story Hagrid told the trio about his mission with Madame Maxime to try and recruit the giants in the fight against Voldemort They were almost caught when Umbridge called on Hagrid that night but hid under the Invisibilty Cloak Hermione forcefully telling Grawp to put her down Months later Hermione and Harry learned why Hagrid was perpetually bruised and cut he had brought his giant half brother Grawp back to Hogwarts as he was getting severely bullied and was trying to teach him human ways After Grawp who had the mental age of a human toddler picked her up Hermione forcefully told him to put him down He subsequently became enamoured with Hermione calling her Hermy It was one of the few words he could pronounce Just after their class took their O W L s Harry had a vision of his godfather being tortured by Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries Hermione was worried that it was a trap and convinced Harry to try to contact Sirius before doing anything rash To that end she accompanied Harry in an act of solidarity as he sneaked into Umbridge s office to use the Floo Network with the assistance of Ron Ginny and Luna Lovegood but they were ultimately caught When Umbridge threatened to use the Cruciatus Curse on Harry during questioning Hermione interceded She came up with a lie that she and her fellow D A members had been building a weapon for Dumbledore thus stopping Umbridge s sadistic interrogation and attempted torture of Harry Hermione and Harry lured Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest Hermione successfully lured Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest by saying that s where the weapon was hidden where Umbridge was carried away by a herd of centaurs She had predicted that the centaurs would let her and Harry go since they did not insult the centaurs and were young enough to be considered foals However the centaurs were already enraged by Umbridge and were further angered when Hermione admitted that she had hoped that they would drive Umbridge off being insulted that they were thought of to do the bidding of humans The centaurs were about to carry the two students off as well but Grawp stumbled onto the scene and a fight broke out between the giant and the herd This allowed Hermione and Harry to escape and meet up with Ron Ginny Luna and Neville who had escaped from the Inquisitorial Squad After a brief argument between Harry and Neville over whether or not the others were going to travel with Harry to London an understanding was reached The six students flew on Thestrals which the majority Hermione included could not even see to the Ministry of Magic to try to save Sirius from Voldemort and his Death Eaters The six D A members battling Death Eaters for possession of the prophecy Hermione s fear turned out to be justified as Harry s vision was a ruse planted in his brain by Voldemort designed to lure him to the Ministry to obtain a prophecy Voldemort sought As soon as Harry did this the six D A members were surrounded by Death Eaters and a battle ensued Hermione stunned Nott when he grabbed Harry thus freeing him and causing Nott to be injured by the collapsing shelves of prophecies She later stunned another Death Eater and Silenced Antonin Dolohov before he could alert the other Death Eaters to the group s location She was critically injured by the curse Dolohov subsequently struck her with but made a full recovery 32 Hermione visiting Weasleys Wizard Wheezes for the first time Hermione achieved high academic prestige when she obtained ten O W L s in Charms Defence Against the Dark Arts Transfiguration Care of Magical Creatures Arithmancy History of Magic Herbology Astronomy Potions and Ancient Runes She received Outstanding marks on each of them except Defence Against the Dark Arts in which she received an Exceeds Expectations In total she achieved 10 O W L s Ron found it amusing that she actually seemed disappointed by this 36 Hermione brewing a Draught of Living Death in a N E W T level Potions lesson By the time they arrived in Hogwarts Hermione s romantic feelings for Ron had become obvious According to Harry the two seemed on their way to a romantic relationship Hermione and Ron s relationship suffered greatly in their sixth year when Ron became envious of both Hermione and Harry who were invited to be members of the Slug Club a group of students favoured by Potions professor Horace Slughorn while he was ignored Hermione strongly disapproved of Harry using the textbook of the Half Blood Prince to get ahead in Potions unfairly though she did not turn him in and indirectly found a clue about the book owner She was particularly alarmed by the increasingly Dark nature of the magic in the book such as the spell Sectumsempra Harry comforting an upset Hermione after she witnessed Ron snogging Lavender However during an argument with his sister Ginny mocked Ron about his inexperience with the opposite gender and told him that Hermione had kissed Viktor Krum during their earlier romance Ron subsequently began treating Hermione coldly much to her bewilderment She was upset when he and Lavender started flirting When she found out about Ron s relationship with Lavender she conjured a flock of wild birds to attack Ron for his insensitivity regarding her feelings He became even angrier with her when she believed that Harry slipped Ron Felix Felicis to assist in his Quidditch playing abilities despite having believed it initially himself he accused her of having no faith in him when it was discovered that he had not been slipped the potion at all After this Hermione attended Slughorn s Christmas party with Cormac McLaggen to get back at Ron but it did not go well due to the former s impoliteness Afterwards Ron who was relieved that Hermione and McLaggen s date did not go well attempted to speak to Hermione but she ignored him still upset and angry over his previous treatment of her 36 This behaviour persisted for quite sometime Madam Pomfrey checking on a poisoned Ron while Hermione Harry and Ginny are sitting by his bedside The two reconciled after Ron was hospitalised due to consuming poisoned mead an event that left Hermione shaken and frightened After the incident she remained unusually quiet and subdued Whilst sitting at Ron s bedside Ron subconsciously muttered Hermione s name By this time Ron was visibly disillusioned with his relationship with Lavender who had become possessive of him and called him by the annoying nickname Won Won He was also pleased whenever Hermione visited him in the hospital wing He began avoiding Lavender who soon became suspicious of his relationship with Hermione ultimately leading to an argument about her After Lavender saw Ron and Hermione come down alone from the boys dormitories Harry was present also but under the invisibility cloak she had a fight with Ron and broke up with him When Ron told Harry and Hermione about breaking up with Lavender Harry could have sworn he saw Hermione smirk Hermione and Ron discussing the Half Blood Prince Afterwards Hermione and Ron were more comfortable together and their relationship improved considerably although a romantic relationship remained out of their reach Hermione comforted Ron after he failed his Apparition test because he Splinched half an eyebrow while he teased her about the instructor s praise for her flawless performance That year Hermione also quickly mastered nonverbal magic the first in her class to do so Throughout the year Hermione and Ron were both sceptical of Harry s theory that Draco Malfoy had been branded with the Dark Mark and was up to something Moreover she was confident that Malfoy couldn t have brought any Dark objects into Hogwarts without alerting Filch These claims were heard by Draco himself who used these details and Hermione s previous plan of communication to accomplish his own A tearful Hermione standing at the base of the Astronomy Tower after Dumbledore s death Near the end of the school year Harry s suspicions would be proven right Malfoy let Death Eaters into the school by means of a pair of vanishing cabinets One cabinet resided in Borgin and Burkes and the other in the Room of Hidden Things as it had been presumed broken but Malfoy managed to fix it This infiltration of Death Eaters resulted in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower Hermione fought in the battle and remained unscathed thanks to some Felix Felicis 36 This was a gift from Harry who had won it in a Potions competition and had a preconceived notion of what was going to happen He told Hermione Ron and Ginny to drink it beforehand in case his worries proved true The funeral of Albus Dumbledore Throughout the school year Hermione and Ron had been informed of the content of Harry s private lessons with Dumbledore Through these lessons Harry and in turn Hermione and Ron learned about the existence of Lord Voldemort s Horcruxes During the funeral of Albus Dumbledore who had been killed by Snape in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower Hermione was comforted by Ron and cried on his shoulder Afterwards Harry told them about his desire to drop out of Hogwarts to hunt Horcruxes which were the key to defeating Lord Voldemort Despite his protests Hermione and Ron promised to forgo their seventh year at Hogwarts in order to assist Harry Before leaving the school Hermione was able to Summon books about Horcruxes so as to learn how to destroy the items She found them in Dumbledore s office where the late headmaster had kept them after the subject had been banned at Hogwarts Hermione modifying her parents memories Hermione began planning for her journey with Harry and Ron immediately Concerned for the safety of her family she altered her parents memories to make them think they were Wendell and Monica Wilkins and sent them to hide in Australia no longer aware of their original identities the existence of their daughter or anything she had told them about Harry She also withdrew all of her savings at her building society account in event of a need for Muggle money 10 The seven Potters and their protectors right before the sky battle Hermione then joined the Order of the Phoenix in the operation to remove Harry from 4 Privet Drive before his 17th birthday taking Polyjuice Potion to become one of the seven Potters Hermione flew on a Thestral with Kingsley Shacklebolt The two fought off at least five Death Eaters possibly killing one injuring two and were pursued by Lord Voldemort himself at one point In time they arrived safely at The Burrow where Hermione was immensely relieved to see Harry alive and ran to him and hugged him tight but she was greatly worried when Ron did not show up on time When he landed she ran and nuzzled him in relief She was saddened by the news of Alastor Moody and Hedwig s murders and disturbed by Harry s vision of Garrick Ollivander being tortured Scrimgeour giving the trio the items left for them in Albus Dumbledore s will Later on the Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour interrupted Harry s birthday celebrations to execute Albus Dumbledore s will and bequeath some of his belongings to the three friends Hermione received The Tales of Beedle the Bard a book of children s stories written in runes Even before Hermione understood the priceless quality of the gift she was moved to tears by Dumbledore s great act of friendship During the reading of Dumbledore s will she also displayed her incredible store of general knowledge when she mentioned that Snitches have flesh memories surprising both Ron and Harry who had both believed her to know little to nothing of Quidditch At Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour s wedding on 1 August 1997 Hermione wore a floaty lilac coloured dress with matching high heels and made her hair sleek and shiny She was amused by Fred and George s stories about their late uncle Bilius and shared a friendly exchange with Viktor Krum to the frustration of Ron She was happily surprised when Ron quickly asked her to dance and when Krum asked a disguised Harry whether the two were together Harry replied Er sort of 10 Kingsley s Patronus warning the wedding attendees of the Ministry s fall The wedding was interrupted by Kingsley Shacklebolt s Patronus who told the guests of the fall of the Ministry of Magic Hermione was prepared to make a quick escape immediately Disapparating herself Harry and Ron away from the danger Hermione also showed great foresight and magical talent when she revealed a small beaded purse on which she had placed an Undetectable Extension Charm Within it she had packed amongst other things clothing a tent healing supplies Harry s Invisibility Cloak and several useful books They arrived on the Muggle street Tottenham Court Road where Hermione suggested they enter a café as a means to get out of the open Hermione casting Petrificus Totalus on Antonin Dolohov However minutes later Hermione unknowingly triggered the Taboo jinx that was placed on Voldemort s name and the trio were thus tracked down by Antonin Dolohov and Thorfinn Rowle After a brief but violent skirmish the Death Eaters were subdued and Hermione modified their memories to throw them off the scent and to maintain Ron s cover story that he was sick with spattergroit and bedridden at home At Harry s suggestion the three then made their way safely to 12 Grimmauld Place as they could not hide anywhere within the wizarding world 10 After learning from Mundungus Fletcher that Dolores Umbridge had Tom Riddle s mother s locket one of the seven Horcruxes in her possession the trio formed a plan to infiltrate the Ministry and reclaim the locket Hermione imbibed Polyjuice Potion and transformed to look like Mafalda Hopkirk a prominent Ministry official She was forced to sit through the trials of Alderton and Mary Cattermole innocent Muggle borns right alongside Umbridge and Death Eater Yaxley Hermione tricked Umbridge into telling her about the locket which she claimed was a Selwyn family heirloom Harry casting his Patronus at Dementors while in the trial courtroom before capturing the locket When Harry attacked Umbridge in a rage their cover was blown but she and Harry managed to free the Muggle born prisoners and encouraged them to flee the country while Voldemort was in power Hermione took the locket from Umbridge replacing it with a copy using the Geminio spell They met up with Ron again and fled the Ministry but Yaxley grabbed onto Hermione s arm while they were Disapparating This meant that he was unwittingly brought inside the enchantment making Grimmauld Place undetectable and forced Hermione to use a Revulsion Jinx to free herself from him and then to take the trio away from Grimmauld Place 10 Harry and Ron rowing before Ron abandoned the hunt The locket caused great pain among the three friends due to the negative energy within They began arguing over petty issues such as cooking and growing moodier The negative energy from the locket caused Ron to accuse Harry of poor leadership They fought physically resulting in Hermione having to stop them before they could start casting spells by casting a Shield Charm between them Ron also accused Hermione of choosing Harry over him causing him to be jealous and feel left out by his two friends growing friendship He declared he was leaving and stormed out of the tent By the time she got rid of the shield charm all Hermione could do was scream for him to come back without success Hermione then cried over Ron for more than a week after his departure although she tried to hide it from Harry Both were deeply saddened and hurt by their friend s departure Hermione more than Harry as she cried over Ron s departure for weeks With Ron gone Hermione and Harry s evenings were spent in mostly silence while they contemplated Ron s abandonment and the places Voldemort s remaining Horcruxes might be hidden Hermione in Bathilda Bagshot s cottage holding the The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore Hermione and Harry soon decided to go to Godric s Hollow to see the graves of Harry s parents and to speak to historian Bathilda Bagshot They believed Bathilda might be holding onto Godric Gryffindor s Sword for Harry as they thought Dumbledore might have left it with her as an old family friend knowing it was the only method the trio knew for destroying a Horcrux Hermione comforted Harry in the graveyard when they found the Potters graves she nuzzled her head in to the crook between his head and shoulders and conjured roses for the graves On their way out of the graveyard they came into contact with what appeared to be Bathilda The pair then went to Bathilda s house whilst in the house they were separated Harry witnessed a giant snake pouring from the neck of Bathilda s body and was attacked by Nagini upstairs Nagini had been waiting for them in the guise of the old woman whose corpse had been animated like an Inferius by Voldemort Hermione rushed to Harry s aid and proceeded to save his life by casting a Blasting Cure which ricocheted around the room The two of them barely escaped before Lord Voldemort himself arrived at the cabin in an attempt to capture Harry Harry and Hermione talking about Albus Dumbledore in the forest of Dean Hermione Apparated to the Forest of Dean while Harry was overcome with pain and visions of Voldemort s attack on his parents and him in 1981 She used a Severing Charm to remove the locket from Harry and healed the bite Nagini had given him with dittany Harry s wand had also been broken in the foray most likely by the Blasting Curse Hermione cast at Nagini Hermione was very upset a the thought that it was her curse that broke Harry s wand Harry was heartbroken but not angry with her knowing that it was an accident and that Hermione had saved his life and therefore could not hold it against her 10 Hermione still upset with Ron even after his return Ron reunited with Harry and Hermione in the Forest of Dean after Ron heard them talking through the Deluminator Dumbledore had left him Ron destroyed the locket Horcrux with Godric Gryffindor s Sword which had been left by an unknown assistant in a pool in the Forest saving Harry s life and thus receiving forgiveness from Harry for leaving Before he destroyed it however the locket revealed some of Ron s deepest fears including that Hermione preferred Harry to him Hermione however was unaware of this as she had been in the tent while this occurred Upon seeing Ron she screamed at Ron despite Harry trying to tell her that Ron just saved his life and punched him until Harry cast a shield charm between them with Hermione s wand She was furious with Ron for days for his abandonment but gradually warmed up to him again The trio speaking with Xenophilius Lovegood at his home near the village of Ottery St Catchpole The trio then travelled together to Xenophilius Lovegood s home to ask him about the strange symbol in The Tales of Beedle the Bard which Xenophilius had worn on a chain around his neck at Bill and Fleur s wedding They had thought it to be the sign of the Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald after Krum recognised it at the wedding Grindelwald being a former Durmstrang student but Xenophilius informed them it was the symbol of the Deathly Hallows Shortly after making this discovery Harry realised that Luna wasn t at home despite it being the Christmas holidays and had been away for a long time Xenophilius revealed to them that Luna had been taken prisoner by Death Eaters and that he planned to betray them in order to get her back Death Eaters ambushing the trio while they were inside the Lovegood home However in attempting to capture them Xenophilius made the Erumpent horn in his living room which he had insisted was a Snorkack horn much to Hermione s annoyance explode giving the trio the chance to hide just as Death Eaters Selwyn and Travers arrived They threatened to kill Luna if they found that Xenophilius had lied about Harry Potter s presence in his home In a remarkable show of mental and magical dexterity Hermione concocted the trio s escape while safeguarding Ron s feigned illness and allowing the Death Eaters to glimpse Harry so that they would not carry out their threat to kill Luna 10 In the spring of 1998 Harry accidentally triggered the Taboo jinx and Hermione Harry and Ron were tracked down and captured by a group of Snatchers which included the werewolf Fenrir Greyback Greyback had developed cannibalistic tendencies when out of werewolf form and was eager to bite Hermione After a brief and violent interrogation by the Snatchers the captives were brought to Malfoy Manor and turned over to Bellatrix Lestrange Bellatrix immediately panicked at the sight of Godric Gryffindor s Sword and incapacitated the Snatchers with ease as she was too quick for them She then ordered them moved to the courtyard where she would deal with them later Bellatrix Lestrange torturing Hermione in Malfoy Manor Bellatrix gave away that what she believed to be the sword and another Horcrux were hidden in her vault at Gringotts in her panic She proceeded to isolate Hermione and then brutally torture her with the Cruciatus Curse repeatedly along with taking a dagger and cutting the word Mudblood into her arm as interrogation methods Ron who had tried to take her place unsuccessfully was reduced to sobs from hearing Hermione scream in pain However Hermione came up with a fake story that the sword was merely a copy of the real thing a lie that Harry persuaded the imprisoned goblin Griphook to go along with Hermione was soon tortured into unconsciousness With Hermione s moans and screams of pain echoing throughout the manor Harry and Ron saw no possible hope left Suddenly Dobby came to the rescue of the prisoners in the dungeon with audible crack as he apparated Harry and Ron fought off Peter Pettigrew who had been sent to investigate the noise Harry snarled at him that Pettigrew owed him for Harry s sparing of his life with Lupin and Sirius and the momentary relaxing of Pettigrew as a result caused him to be choked to death by his own silver hand created by Voldemort for showing Harry mercy Bellatrix holding her silver knife to Hermione s throat They raced upstairs and were forced to drop their wands when Bellatrix held a silver knife to Hermione s throat Bellatrix cut through some skin leaving a thin cut on the front of Hermione s neck Right when Bellatrix was about to slit her throat Dobby returned and sent the chandelier crashing to the floor knocking Bellatrix over and enabling Harry to grab their wands from Draco and Disapparate with Hermione Ron Griphook and Dobby to Shell Cottage where Bill and Fleur Weasley took up residence after their marriage Unfortunately Dobby was killed during this escape by a knife Bellatrix threw The trio speaking with Griphook about what lay within the Lestrange vault Hermione Harry and Ron stayed at Shell Cottage for some time whilst Fleur helped Hermione recover from her trauma Ron didn t leave Hermione s bedside throughout this time The trio formed a plan to break into the Lestrange Vault at Gringotts to retrieve the Horcrux Helga Hufflepuff s Cup with the reluctant assistance of Griphook The goblin only agreed to help them in exchange for Gryffindor s Sword although lothe to lose it Hermione was strongly against deceiving or double crossing Griphook who was startled by the care she and Harry had shown for house elves since most wizards do not think highly of non human beings The trio reluctantly agreed to Griphook s terms Ron and Hermione disguised as Dragomir Despard and Bellatrix Lestrange Once more Hermione used Polyjuice Potion containing Bellatrix s hair She was also forced to use Bellatrix s wand as her wand had been confiscated by Snatchers She very much disliked this as the wand in question had caused so much suffering such as contributing to Sirius murder She stated that the wand felt wrong and Harry speculated that it was because Hermione had not won the wand s intelligence It was determined that Hermione was too polite to really impersonate Bellatrix as she did not treat those around her like scum Despite this the group managed to get into the vault mainly because of Harry s use of the Imperius Curse After many harrowing challenges and Griphook betraying them out of a belief that they would not have kept to their agreement Hermione Ron and Harry escaped on the back of the half blind dragon that was guarding the vault with another Horcrux in their possession 10 Hermione and Ron destroying the cup in the Chamber of Secrets The trio finally returned to Hogwarts on 2 May 1998 with the assistance of Aberforth Dumbledore after Harry had a vision that the remaining Horcrux they had not identified but suspected was something formerly belonging to Rowena Ravenclaw was hidden at the school They were reunited with their friends in the reformed Dumbledore s Army who declared their wish to fight the encroaching Death Eater army Whilst Harry and Luna went to Ravenclaw Tower Hermione and Ron retrieved Basilisk fangs from the Chamber of Secrets in order to use them to destroy Horcruxes and Hermione destroyed Hufflepuff s Cup Soon after reuniting with Harry Ron expressed concern for the house elves in the Hogwarts kitchens prompting Hermione to kiss him for the very first time Ron responded with great enthusiasm but they quickly broke apart when Harry reminded them of their objective Hermione and Ron running from the towering flames of Fiendfyre The trio then entered the Room of Requirement in search for Rowena Ravenclaw s Diadem but were ambushed by Draco Malfoy Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe Hermione dodged a Killing Curse and managed to stun Goyle and then she and Ron dragged him out of the room on a broomstick as it went up in flames due to Crabbe s cursed Fiendfyre which also destroyed the Horcrux Harry rescued Draco but Crabbe was killed by his creation Harry Hermione and Ron then witnessed the death of Fred Weasley which devastated them all Despite their grief the trio continued with the effort to track down Nagini the last Horcrux that they knew of On their way Hermione incapacitated two Death Eaters who were pursuing her Harry and Ron and blasted Fenrir Greyback away from an injured Lavender Brown Lavender unfortunately still tragically died afterwards from her injuries The trio was swarmed by Dementors and all had difficulty summoning their Patronuses because of the horror of their recent experiences but Luna Ernie Macmillan and Seamus Finnigan came to their assistance Under Harry s Invisibility Cloak the three made their way to the Shrieking Shack where they witnessed Voldemort have Nagini kill Severus Snape as he had ultimately incorrectly assumed that the Elder Wand s loyalty lay with Snape During the brief pause in fighting when Voldemort issued an ultimatum to Harry Hermione comforted Ginny Weasley over Fred s death When Voldemort and his army approached with a supposedly dead Harry Hermione screamed in horror and denial Hermione witnessing Harry s final defeat of Lord Voldemort The Battle of Hogwarts soon resumed and Hermione fought Bellatrix Lestrange alongside Ginny and Luna despite being hindered by using Bellatrix s own wand against her When Bellatrix nearly killed Ginny Molly Weasley took over the fight and killed Bellatrix Hermione witnessed Harry s final defeat of Lord Voldemort and she and Ron reached him first overjoyed Hermione survived the battle relatively unscathed only suffering minor injuries and burns she received from entering the Lestranges Vault shortly before the battle 10 At some point Hermione found her parents in Australia and restored their memories In 1998 Hermione went back to Hogwarts to attain her N E W T s 37 During the trial of Dolores Umbridge shortly after the war Umbridge managed to escape and ally with some Death Eaters Corban Yaxley the Carrows and Walden Macnair Together they planned a plot involving Time Turners to bring back the dictatorship that had existed in the British Ministry of Magic from 1997 1998 They were stopped however by Hermione Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley 38 At some point between 2010 and 2011 Hermione travelled to Diagon Alley where she accidentally bumped into a Hogwarts student causing both of them to drop their belongings After the two apologised to each other Hermione noticed that the spine on one of the student s books was broken watching as they used the Mending Charm to fix it Hermione asked if the student was enjoying their time at Hogwarts which the student confirmed although they admitted feeling somewhat overwhelmed on account of being Muggle born Hermione herself a Muggle born witch reassured the student that they didn t have to learn everything in their first year before asking them what their favourite class was Upon hearing their answer she explained that Study of Ancient Runes was one of her favourite classes to which the student who hadn t previously recognised Hermione revealed that they had just purchased a copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard newly translated from Ancient Runes by Hermione Granger noting that the picture of the author looked just like her Hermione explained that she was indeed the author of the book and thanked them for buying a copy asking them to send her an owl when they had finished in order to hear their thoughts on it Hermione then wished the student luck in their studies asking them to say hello to Neville Longbottom and Rubeus Hagrid for her as well 33 Hermione encountering the student at Hogwarts On 19 September her birthday of a certain year Hermione went back to Hogwarts in reminiscence While at Hogwarts she visited the Library as it was one of her favourite locations within the school During her school days she spent extensive amounts of time within its walls While in the library she encountered the same student She noticed the book they were holding and told her story that involved it 39 Hermione with others at the end of the battle Hermione also came to Hogwarts s aid when the school fell under attack by Dementors and other Dark creatures and joined the big battle at the end When it was over she discussed the possible cause of the attacks with Harry Ron and the Hogwarts staff noting that the other creatures couldn t have been swayed by the Dementors to join the attacks since they were not easily affected by them as humans would be 40 Hermione and Harry meeting the student at Zonko s When Ron Weasley asked Hermione to help him sell joke products and compete against his brother George who had already invited Harry she couldn t say no and so she came to Zonko s Joke Shop when they were having a sale there though she didn t really care for pranks and found that she was not good at promoting the products with passion She was having a conversation with Harry in the shop when they met the Muggle born student who was surprised to see Hermione was the important guest that Ron claimed to have invited seeing as she didn t seem to be the kind of person that was interested in joke products Hermione agreed and talked about her feelings with them and gave them some tokens to buy products with to save herself from doing her promotion speech 41 Hermione with her husband and two children By 2017 Hermione and Ron were married with two children Rose and Hugo Granger Weasley She had several nieces and nephews through her marriage to Ron Hermione was also the godmother of Harry and Ginny Potter s eldest child James Sirius 42 Newspaper report on the trio joining the Ministry Hermione attained a high position in the Ministry of Magic first through the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures There she continued her work with S P E W working for the rights of underprivileged non humans such as house elves She tried to get his house elf Gaby to take temporary possession of the Bewildering Bloom after Yubert Thorne was imprisoned and to send scarves and other items to house elves at Hogwarts through a student friend of hers 43 She then went on to become Deputy Head 12 of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and assisted the Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt in eradicating the old laws biased in favour of pure bloods Along with Harry and Ron she helped to revolutionise the Ministry and reform the wizarding world At some point Hermione Harry and Ron were all featured on Chocolate Frog Cards for their accomplishments 44 Hermione also eventually translated The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the original which had been written in runes and which Albus Dumbledore bequeathed to her in his will in 1997 Her new translation was published in 2008 and included notes on each tale written by Dumbledore before his death these notes were lent to Hermione by her former professor Hogwarts Headmistress Minerva McGonagall 45 Both Hermione and Ron attended the 2014 Quidditch World Cup and sat in VIP Box Two Rita Skeeter noted that Ron had become catatonic at the appearance of the Bulgarian Veela and Hermione had to elbow him in the ribs On 1 September 2017 Hermione and Ron brought their children to King s Cross Station to see Rose off for her first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and met Harry Ginny and their three children there At some point between 2019 and 2020 Hermione was elected as Minister for Magic 46 In the summer of 2020 Hermione had to visit Harry to ask him to complete his paperwork and the other tasks he was yet to do She talked about her concerns for recent activity similar to ones which happened when Voldemort was alive Harry reminded her that he did just find a Time Turner and he would get round to the rest of the tasks in his own time They agreed that the Time Turner should be destroyed and Hermione hid it away A few months later Hermione was returning to her office when she was stopped by Ron who was really Albus Potter transfigured to look like Ron Albus was trying to stall her while Scorpius Malfoy and Delphi stole the Time Turner Hermione found Ron annoying although he stalled her long enough for the others to find the Time Turner and they left Hermione had found out about Harry s nightmares and how his scar was hurting again and she called a meeting However no one thought it was a threat Hermione and Ron standing in her office at the Ministry of Magic Hermione s life was changed by Albus and Scorpius when they meddled with time In one alternate reality she did not marry Ron and became the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts In another alternate reality where Harry died Hermione was in hiding as a member of what remained of Dumbledore s Army with Ron and Severus Snape When Scorpius turned up with information about the original timeline where they won Hermione agreed to help put time right again by time travelling to the moment Scorpius changed time and use a Shield Charm to stop him Hermione was the one to use the charm first but when they returned to the present it was still changed They were attacked by Dementors and Hermione and Ron professed their love for each other and sacrificed their souls to the Dementors to give Scorpius time to escape Hermione Granger as a Defence Against the Dark Arts professor in the alternate timeline When time was right again Hermione visited Hogwarts to attend a meeting with Professor McGonagall Hermione along with Ron Harry Ginny and Draco were very forgiving of what Albus and Scorpius did but McGonagall reminded them of great dangers that happened and could still have been because they meddled with time When Albus and Scorpius were kidnapped by Delphi and made to travel in time again to 31 October 1981 Hermione travelled in time again with Ron Harry Ginny and Draco Malfoy to save them Hermione helped transfigure Harry to look like Voldemort to trick Delphi who hopes to save him and then later helped Harry duel Delphi She and Draco then apprehended her and took her back to the present where she was sent to Azkaban During the Calamity Hermione acted as one of the apparent leading members of the newly created Statute of Secrecy Task Force and would introduce members who had proven to be qualified to Professions after complimenting on their impressive combination of determination and ability She would also help the members personally instructing those who pursued a professorship on the Proficiency Charm after returning from a sojourn overseas while giving Aurors a retrospective regarding her experiences in the Second Wizarding War to help them in fighting Death Eaters 13 Hermione sent a Calamity Investigator working for the Task Force to reverse the accidental shrinking of several tea shops in Dagenham by George Weasley as a result of testing one of his new joke products a Tea Snug a task which they quickly completed Hermione later gave an impromptu talk about the Calamity at the Leaky Cauldron which was attended by the same Calamity Investigator From this talk the Calamity Investigator learned about the ineffability of the Calamity from which they figured out a new way to improve their Trace Charm 13 Hermione later learned that the same Calamity Investigator had discovered a large number of fire breathing chickens beneath an inn in Brondby Denmark and brought them back to the Ministry as they had recently become a noted wizarding delicacy Hermione thanked the Calamity Investigator by securing them higher energy meals at wizarding bed and breakfast inns She later hosted a practical class on localised casting of the Sunlight Charm which was attended by the same Calamity Investigator As part of the class Hermione demonstrated that the volume of light produced could be modulated with specific wrist motions which the Calamity Investigator used to improve their use of the Greenhouse Charm Hermione also presented the same Calamity Investigator with the then newly created Green Wand award for their painstaking gathering of greenhouse ingredients every day 13 In the spring of 2021 The Unforgivable threatened Harry Potter and Hermione after the two began wrenching control of Calamity surges away from the cabal The two feared that their children would be targeted but Harry insisted on continuing to fight against the Unforgivable Harry redirected a Calamity surge and controlled it using memories of the Marauders When Minerva McGonagall was uncharacteristically late in reporting to the SOS Task Force Constance Pickering Harry Potter and Hermione Granger feared she had been attacked By April it became apparent that while Minerva was unharmed Ginny had been attacked and Ron had been abducted 47 Following their attack on Harry s wife and Hermione s husband the Unforgivable unleashed a surge of Dragon Adversaries While this was disastrous it allowed Harry to tap into somebody s memory of being forced to abduct Ron 48 Shortly after the Unforgivable unleashed a surge of Foundables related to Weasleys Wizard Wheezes where Ron worked While the Unforgivable succeeded in intimidating Harry and Hermione Harry even enlisted the help of MACUSA in the hopes of finding his best friend this attack only made Hermione even more determined to bring the cabal to justice 49 The Unforgivable began a campaign of harassment and manipulation to secure their position preceding negotiations for Ron s returns including implanting false memories in Molly Weasley of Ron crying and begging her to tell Harry and Hermione to listen to the Unforgivable so that he could return home Molly instead instructed Hermione to give them Hell 50 By the end of April the Unforgivable had delivered their list of demands via notes dispatched within Foundables In exchange for Ron s safe return they not only wanted full command of the Calamity but for London Five victim Kit Gerrard and the defector informant Flavius Flint to be delivered to them Hermione decided that she and Constance should use Polyjuice Potion to take the places of Gerrard and Flint as a means to infiltrate the Unforgivable with Harry delivering them in exchange for Ron It seemed the Unforgivable were aware of this deception as well as where the Ministry s defences were weakest however Whilst duelling against members of the cabal Constance was hit with a Blasting Curse but luckily came away with only mild burns While Ron was recovering albeit unconscious the real Flavius and Kit were taken When Constance returned from having her injuries healed at St Mungo s she reported that Ron had woken up and his memories had been completely Obliviated to the point where he could not even recognise his wife 48 Hermione wondered if everything including rescuing Ron had been part of the cabal s plans all along She and Harry considered the possibility of a mole in the Ministry or a Legilimens among the Unforgivable s ranks 50 In May 2021 Calamity surges surrounding baby magical creatures created the impression that the Unforgivable were involved in illegal poaching and trading of rare beasts Fragments of a note apparently from Grim Fawley contained co ordinates to a location in Cape Town to where Harry Potter led a team of Aurors in order to stop a potential auction and to find members of the cabal Unfortunately no auction took place adding weight to the theory of a mole in the Ministry The return of mountain troll and Acromantula fragments caused Ron Weasley to remember events from his past though he still could not remember the names of people close to him 51 Following this Hermione resorted to drugging various Ministry members with Truth Serum then erasing their memories of being interrogated by her This method outed Gareth Greengrass as not only the mole but a high ranking member of the Unforgivable 52 Hermione hoped that the detention of Gareth Greengrass would put a stop to the appearance of Adversaries however instead the SOS Taskforce was inundated with an unprecedented surge of all known Feared Adversaries over the course of a week 14 21 July 2021 Hermione speculated that perhaps Greengrass was capable of manipulating the Calamity without a wand though Constance thought it might be that Greengrass was not the one responsible Hermione also claimed that anyone who could bring Darkness like this into the world must be capable of powerful magic 53 Following his detention Gareth Greengrass repeatedly proclaimed innocence and his colleagues in the Department of Mysteries called for his release even going so far as to accuse Harry and Hermione of using the Imperius Curse to obtain a false confession As testimony procured under Veritaserum was inadmissible and there was no paper trail or actual evidence of Greengrass s involvement with the Unforgivable Hermione turned her attention to helping Ron recover his memories of the 1992 1993 school year During this time an Auror discovered that Gareth s strange habit of delivering Interdepartmental Memos via owl was part of a ruse Gareth s owl was a Transfigured potions cabinet containing Polyjuice Potion When tested those who imbibed the potions turned into Hermione and the editor in chief of the Daily Prophet linking Gareth Greengrass to the abductions of Ginny and Ron A complication arose however when it became apparent one of the Polyjuice Potions had been tampered with during the month that Gareth was detained Hermione concluded that this was part of an escape attempt and alerted Harry 54 Gareth Greengrass was eventually caught out and taken into custody in an official capacity but remained tight lipped until Harry rose the issue of Gareth s daughter It was discovered that Cereus Greengrass suffered a blood malediction Gareth and Harry formed an Unbreakable Vow sealed by Constance Pickering whereby Harry would find a cure for Gareth s daughter and in turn Gareth would help Harry uncover the identities of the Unforgivable Harry visited St Mungo s and placed a large donation securing special care for Cereus By the time he returned however Gareth Greengrass was dead During these events Hermione contemplated the likelihood of Gareth hiding information in their conversations and concluded that Penelope Fawley might be trapped in an image much like Kit Gerrard had been She went to check a photograph of Grim and Penelope that was on Gareth s desk only to find it had gone missing A mysterious male figure was implicated but not identified 55 Hermione in her fifth year Hermione had a light complexion bright brown eyes lots of bushy brown hair once described as a long mane of brown hair 36 and as a child rather large front teeth 15 16 She possessed a bossy sort of voice that would become slightly shrill when she was angry 32 Hermione generally wore plain black work robes Otherwise she dressed casually She usually kept her hair long and sometimes tied it back in a plait 10 Hermione never gave much attention to her appearance usually hiding her potential to be considered extremely pretty under her bushy hairstyle and a large pile of books which she kept slung on her back 3 Hermione in her seventh and final year In 1994 after Hermione was accidentally struck with a Densaugeo spell Madam Pomfrey magically shrank her front teeth and told Hermione to alert her when her teeth had returned to their original size Hermione deviously let the spell continue a little longer evening them out and making it unnecessary for her to receive the braces that her parents both dentists had originally intended for her Hermione later confessed that she had previously considered fixing her teeth with magic but resisted out of respect for her parents During the Yule Ball Hermione revealed that when she put her mind to it she could look quite pretty she used Sleekeazy s Hair Potion to fix her hair making it sleek and shiny and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head She wore robes made of a floaty periwinkle blue material and she held herself differently Harry himself failed to recognise her initially and was shocked when he did for she didn t look at all like her usual self Even Pansy Parkinson gaped at Hermione when she saw her and Draco seemed unable to find an insult to throw at her 35 A similar transformation was seen during the wedding of Bill and Fleur her hair was again sleek and shiny and she wore a floaty lilac coloured dress with matching high heels Hermione was known to read for recreation and for fun Hermione was noted for both her exceptional work ethic and insatiable curiosity coming out on top in most of her classes and continuously aiding Harry and Ron in their adventures She was so studious that the Ministry allowed her a Time Turner in her third year a device that rewinds time so that she could take extra courses 34 Because of her efficiency and compassion Hermione often had time to do hobby work on the side such as preparing a defence for Buckbeak to save him from execution and creating S P E W an organisation promoting the freedom of house elves 35 Such acts demonstrated her social conscience and tenacity Hermione s enthusiasm in class Unlike most wizards who depended solely on their magical ability Hermione readily relied on logic which often helped her to cleverly deduce information that many others missed such as Remus Lupin s lycanthropy 34 However her emphasis on logic made her sceptical about accepting anything without proof as opposed to Harry who would come to intuitive conclusions such as completely dismissing the idea of the Deathly Hallows refusing to believe in them without physical evidence 10 Hermione s logic had limits putting her beliefs before all else at the same time in a way that made her ignore reality when it contradicted what she believed no matter how strong or overwhelming the evidence was An example of this was the reality of the house elves she insisted that they wanted to be free have wages and only seemed happy because they were under educated and brainwashed when her friends told her that they like their lot in life even after the elves themselves told her they were happy and didn t want her help because they don t usually think the way humans do 35 Even though Hermione knew a lot about the wizarding world she was not well informed about the children s culture of the wizarding world until Albus Dumbledore gave her his copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard as she grew up in a Muggle household and did not know she was a witch until her pre teens 10 Hermione was quite blunt with her opinions sometimes to the point of being tactless For example her attempt to comfort Lavender Brown about the death of her rabbit did not go over well 34 and her honesty when dealing with centaurs in 1996 nearly landed her and Harry in serious trouble 32 Despite this Hermione was generally sensitive to others emotions and would lie when she had to though she wasn t a skilled liar 32 She also gave her friends advice rather often such as in trying to make Harry understand Cho Chang s behaviour on their date 32 and in helping Ginny deal with her crush on Harry 36 These actions once prompted Ron to advise her to write a book to translate all the mad things girls do so that boys could understand them 32 Hermione was very responsible a strict perfectionist and well put together who often attempted to act as the voice of reason among her more impulsive friends to varying levels of success These traits led to her being made a prefect during her fifth year Throughout her entire school career Hermione was insistent on order and steadfastly devoted to the rules often at the expense of her popularity Her sense of humour was limited frequently expressing disapproval over Fred and George s practical jokes and threatened to put them in detention for selling prank items in the common room Hermione arguing with Harry Potter over the Half blood Prince s copy of Advanced Potion Making Hermione was very determined and focused in that she always kept her attention focused on the job that must be done 56 Her refusal to break under torture shows her strength of willpower 10 She wasn t afraid to stand up to her friends when she thought it was in their best interests or when she felt they were wrong risking to anger Harry by getting his Firebolt confiscated because she feared it might be jinxed 34 and arguing with both him and Ginny over his use of the shady Half Blood Prince s textbook 36 In spite of her strait laced disposition she wasn t above using coercion and threats to get what she wanted achieve results or protect herself and those she cared about in the long run This is evidenced by her blackmailing Rita Skeeter into writing a good article about Harry 4 as well as slapping Draco Malfoy when he insulted Hagrid and drawing her wand on him using a Confundus Charm on Cormac McLaggen for insulting her friends and placing a jinx on the list of DA members that would cause them to sprout boils all over their face in the word SNEAK if they betrayed the organisation Malfoy Rita Skeeter and Marietta Edgecombe all served as examples of Hermione s ferocity Hermione urging Harry and Ron to take studying seriously Because of her opinionated interfering nature Hermione had the reputation for being a bossy know it all Her sometimes abrasive attitude masked deep insecurities and fear of failure as personified by her Boggart 57 She felt the need to prove herself perhaps partly because of how many people in wizarding society looked down on Muggle borns However she didn t let anyone bully her about this and ignored bigots like Draco Malfoy Despite her growing confidence in her abilities Hermione wasn t arrogant or conceited and helped her classmates with their schoolwork whenever she could In her fifth year she also became one of the few people to call Voldemort by name 32 Though she initially showed a tendency toward mild panic in sudden situations 3 in time she was able to overcome this trait of hers and demonstrated her bravery and extreme loyalty to her friends many times when facing danger risking her life frequently to help them and standing by Harry even when no one else did Although she wasn t as short tempered as her friends Hermione displayed a formidable fury on several occasions such as slapping Draco Malfoy in defence of Hagrid 34 sabotaging Cormac McLaggen s tryout as a Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team after he insulted Ron and Ginny conjuring a flock of canaries to attack Ron in their sixth year 36 and physically attacking him when he briefly abandoned her and Harry during their hunt for Horcruxes 10 She also tended to be rather argumentative a trait most evident in her interactions with Ron Hermione s corporeal Patronus form of an otter Hermione proved to be an extremely powerful and talented young witch Even before she began her education at Hogwarts she practised some simple spells which all worked 3 Remus Lupin claimed that Hermione was the cleverest witch of her age he had ever met 34 Her magical capability easily surpassed almost every single student in her year challenged only by a select few Hermione being the first in her class to master the Levitation Charm Hermione erasing Antonin Dolohov s memories Hermione conjuring a wreath of flowers in Godric s Hollow Christmas 1997 Hermione and Ron duelling Death Eaters during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries Hermione freezing Neville Longbottom with the Full Body Bind Curse in her first year Hermione being one of only twelve students attending a N E W T level Potions class Hermione Granger handling a Mandrake in a second year Herbology class Hermione healing a Splinched Ron with Essence of Dittany in 1997 Hermione demonstrating her duelling reflexes by blasting Fenrir Greyback during the Battle of Hogwarts Hermione s first wand Crookshanks The Tales of Beedle the Bard Hogwarts A History Hermione s favourite book Hermione in her dress robes Hermione s Yule Ball earrings The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore Bellatrix Lestrange s first wand Mrs Granger her mother Mr and Mrs Granger were Muggle dentists who seemed proud of their witch daughter They appeared to be accepting of the wizarding world as they went shopping with Hermione in Diagon Alley and allowed her to spend several holidays with the Weasley family 4 but did not approve of their daughter using magic as a quick fix as indicated by their not allowing Hermione to magically fix her teeth 35 They correspond by owl post with their daughter throughout the school year 32 but other than one holiday in France with her parents Hermione spent almost all of her time in the wizarding world In 1995 she planned to go skiing with them during the Christmas holidays but ended up going to 12 Grimmauld Place to try to cheer Harry up instead Hermione told her parents that the reason for her cancelling was to study for exams indicating that her parents expected her to do well in school and were probably not aware of the extent of their daughter s involvement in activities relating to the Second Wizarding War 32 Mr Granger her father To protect them during the height of the war Hermione modified her parents memories in 1997 to make them believe they were entirely different people and they left the country 10 After the war she found them in Australia and restored their memories Hermione hugging Rose before Rose departs for school After the Second Wizarding War Hermione had two children with Ron Weasley a daughter named Rose and a son named Hugo Rose started her first year at Hogwarts in 2017 along with her cousin Albus Ron stated that Rose had inherited her mother s brains Hermione was probably very close to Rose because she was also described as smart yet not a complete know it all Hugo was born in 2006 or 2007 He most likely inherited his father s Quidditch skills as he was noted to fly a lot with his cousins Albus Potter and James Potter He also appeared to have a quiet demeanour The Potter children some of Hermione s nieces and nephews As four of Ron Weasley s five surviving siblings were married by 2017 Hermione had quite a few nieces and nephews through her husband Harry and Ginny had three children James Albus and Lily as did Bill and Fleur Victoire Dominique and Louis while George and Angelina Johnson had a son and a daughter Fred and Roxanne and Percy Weasley had two daughters Molly and Lucy with his wife Audrey Victoire Weasley one of Fleur and Bill s daughters was seen kissing Teddy Lupin at King s Cross Station by James Potter Hermione s nephew and godson Hermione visited them all on many occasions It can be assumed that she was closest with Harry s children The Weasley family her future in laws Because of her friendships with Ron and Ginny Weasley Hermione became friendly with the entire Weasley family She spent a portion of many of her summer holidays at their home of The Burrow and attended some family outings with them such as shopping for school supplies in Diagon Alley and attending the 1994 Quidditch World Cup with them Arthur Weasley was fascinated by the Muggle world and thus Hermione s background and even invited Hermione s parents for a drink upon first meeting them Molly Weasley was fond of Hermione though she treated her coldly for a brief time after Rita Skeeter printed lies about Hermione toying with the hearts of Harry Potter and Viktor Krum much to Hermione s bewilderment After Harry explained that the stories were false Mrs Weasley once again warmed up to Hermione Also she and Percy Weasley were considered to be on good terms until their fight over elf rights Fred and George Weasley her friends and future brothers in law Fred and George Weasley seemed to regard Hermione and Harry almost like other younger siblings teasing them as well as being protective of them When Draco Malfoy called Hermione a Mudblood in 1992 the twins were outraged and attempted to attack him 4 Although Hermione disapproved of some of their antics trying to use her status as a prefect to keep them in line she still got on well with them Hermione once argued with them that the Ageing Potion they planned on using to trick the age line protecting the Goblet of Fire wouldn t work because Dumbledore would have already thought of a foolish ageing potion They didn t listen and tried to cross the line which resulted in them being thrown back and grow long white beards The only time she was notably angry with them was when they tested out their Skiving Snackboxes on unsuspecting first year students though the twins initially scoffed at her concerns and her ability to make them stop they backed down when she threatened to tell their mother However Hermione still admired the cleverness and creativity of their spell work 32 once remarking that they could do some extraordinary magic which Fred was flattered enough by to offer Hermione material from their joke shop free of charge 36 Fred and George also tried to get Hermione to relax joking around with her about things such as their late uncle Bilius s penchant for making mischief at weddings 10 Hermione was devastated when Fred was killed during the Battle of Hogwarts Hermione was not as close to the other Weasley siblings though she was invited to Bill s wedding to Fleur Delacour in 1997 With her marriage to Ron Hermione became a part of the Weasley family herself Fleur Delacour her future sister in law When Hermione first met Fleur Delacour an incredibly beautiful French part Veela witch in 1994 during the Triwizard Tournament Hermione disliked Fleur almost immediately as she was given to fussily and loudly criticising nearly everything at Hogwarts from the weather to the decoration and food The fact that Ron had a little bit of a crush on Fleur didn t help but he eventually got over it Hermione like Ginny and Mrs Weasley was infuriated by Fleur s arrogance and constant complaining when Bill Weasley sent Fleur his then fiancée to The Burrow to get to know his family However when Fleur responded to Bill becoming permanently disfigured by Fenrir Greyback with indignant denial that Bill s appearance would in any way effect their marital plans Hermione most likely set her feelings aside Despite seeming rather inconsiderate and self centred Fleur proved to be courageous and ultimately caring even selfless in her own way She put her life in danger by posing as one of Harry s decoys in the Battle of the Seven Potters and after the Battle of Malfoy Manor Hermione Harry and Ron along with Luna Lovegood Dean Thomas and an injured Garrick Ollivander and Griphook stayed with Bill and Fleur for a month at Shell Cottage where Fleur took care of them all like a mother Later Fleur became Hermione s sister in law through her marriage to Bill Weasley and Hermione s marriage to Ron Weasley Ron Weasley the love of her life and father to her children Ronald Weasley was essentially the love of Hermione s life Although their relationship would have many ups and downs Hermione and Ron Weasley were good friends for most of their years at Hogwarts and of course were best friends with Harry Potter who was usually a mediator in their disputes They tended to argue frequently though they usually got over their arguments which tended to be minor or about trivial issues although there were a few times when it seemed as if their friendship would be irreparable As they grew older and matured Ron and Hermione tended to fight less often and become more in touch with their feelings for each other Hermione sometimes had the tendency of calling Ron Ronald Their first major falling out was in their third year when Ron accused Hermione s pet cat Crookshanks of eating his pet rat Scabbers 34 Hints of her feelings for Ron were shown as early as their first year when she was badly hurt emotionally when he made fun of her for not having friends due to her bookish and bossy nature According to Neville she spent the whole afternoon crying in the loo before the incident with the troll took place In their third year Ron saw Sirius Black standing over him with a knife Hermione was shocked and scared the most and even cried They were both very awkward and embarrassed at times being insecure with their own feelings for each other Ron was used to always being in Harry s shadow and did not want the girl he loved to be also taken from him by his best friend Hermione was greatly offended when Ron initially didn t ask her to the Yule Ball as his partner until he got rejected by Fleur Delacour When it is revealed Viktor Krum was Hermione s date a jealous Ron got into a heated row with Hermione which she ended by making clear that she would go as Ron s date in future if only he asked her as his first choice Ron and Hermione s relationship again suffered when Ron began dating Lavender Brown in 1996 though the two reconciled after Ron was accidentally poisoned leaving Hermione shaken Ron s relationship with Lavender ended soon after and both he and Hermione were more content for it 36 Hermione and Ron expressing their affection for each other Hints of romantic feelings between the two could be seen as early as their second year as Ron was particularly protective of Hermione and disgusted by her crush on Gilderoy Lockhart Also During the second year when Malfoy insulted Hermione calling her a mudblood an enraged Ron attempted to punish him with a curse but as his wand was broken the curse backfired on him injuring him 4 During the Yule Ball in 1994 Hermione was affronted by Ron s clumsy attempt to ask her to go with him and Ron was jealous of her attendance with Viktor Krum this jealousy would persist for years In turn Hermione was jealous of Ron s crush on Fleur Delacour though expressed it in a subtler way In her fourth year while Harry and Ron were not in speaking terms following Harry s name coming out of the goblet of fire Hermione defended Ron to Harry reminding him that despite him not wanting it he always gets all the attention while Ron had to live up competing with his five older brothers and Ron is always made to feel second to him In their fifth year Hermione kissed Ron on the cheek before the Quidditch Tournament to which he reacted by being puzzled and touching the spot where she kissed him During Gryffindor s Quidditch try outs in their sixth year Hermione also Confunded Cormac McLaggen to increase Ron s chances of being made the team s Keeper Also Hermione became jealous but she tried to conceal it when Ron began dating Lavender Brown and kissing her frequently Ron and Hermione spending time together during the Horcrux hunt By the summer of 1997 the two were closer than ever and sort of together according to Harry They danced together at Bill and Fleur s wedding and were generally kinder to one another During the hunt for the Horcruxes Ron comforted Hermione several times by putting his arm around her and Harry believed that they might have fallen asleep holding hands When Harry was briefly shouting at Hermione who was confronting him about his fallout with Remus Lupin Ron defended Hermione from Harry by angrily saying Don t you start on her Hermione was extremely upset when Ron temporarily left her and Harry crying often and she was absolutely furious with him when he returned It was also revealed through a vision caused by the locket Horcrux that one of Ron s deepest fears was that Hermione preferred Harry to him Ron and Hermione s first kiss during the Battle of Hogwarts The two eventually made up and Hermione initiated a kiss during the Battle of Hogwarts when Ron suggested saving the house elves and not ordering them to fight for wizards Hermione who had been a promoter of house elf rights since her fourth year and even started her own society to help house elves the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare was so delighted at Ron s unexpected display of sensitivity that she kissed him on the lips something that was met with surprise eagerness and enthusiasm but caused the pair to become embarrassed after Harry asked them to hold it in Some people had expected Ron and Hermione to become more than friends much sooner and Harry Potter had even thought that they would start dating in their sixth year In the fifth year while Hermione and Harry were arguing about Harry s decision to talk to Sirius Hermione asked Ron s advice in a manner that reminded irresistibly of Mrs Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry s first dinner in Grimmauld Place In 1997 when the Trio was captured by Snatchers and brought to Malfoy Manor Fenrir Greyback mistakenly called Ron Hermione s boyfriend when she tried to protect him Also Ron screamed and yelled and was in terrible distress when he heard Hermione being tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange in Malfoy Manor The pair eventually married and had two children Rose and Hugo Weasley 10 They were rather young when they were married and their relationship evolved over time By the time that Hermione was elected Minister For Magic Ron had become more the stay at home dad due to the convenience it placed on their respective careers as Ron s entrepreneurial exploits could be more easily conducted than Hermione s careers in law enforcement and eventually politics Their combative relationship eventually subsided for a more affectionate one as Ron was seen to kiss Hermione in public extremely often as noted by their nephew Albus Potter Hermione was initially wary when Ron spoke of how early they had married and was jokingly suspicious that he wanted a break from their marriage but was deeply moved when Ron told her that he wanted to renew their vows and marry her all over again after reading about how Muggles occasionally did such a thing Hermione was so touched by her husband s suggestion that they began to kiss passionately over her mountain of paperwork in her office This shows how Ron had matured into a startling romantic over the years and how it helped to temper their initially rocky relationship that begun 31 years prior Viktor Krum her friend and Yule Ball date Viktor Krum a renowned professional Quidditch player and student of Durmstrang came to Hogwarts in 1994 for the Triwizard Tournament in which he was a Champion He took to following Hermione into the library watching her and trying to pluck up the courage to speak to her Eventually he asked her to be his date to the Yule Ball and Hermione accepted Their arrival together caused something of a stir given Viktor s fame and Hermione s exceptional and rather unexpected beauty Hermione was Viktor s hostage during the Second Task of the Tournament After he pulled her from the lake Viktor told Hermione that he had never felt about someone the way he felt about her and invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer 35 At some point it is alleged by Ginny Weasley during a confrontation with her brother Ron that he and Hermione shared a kiss during that period 36 Whether or not Ginny was just trying to get under Ron s skin or if this actually happened is unknown What is known is that their relationship never became serious enough for her to visit him in Bulgaria they kept in contact through letters over the years 32 They met again at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour in 1997 where Viktor complimented Hermione and was disappointed to learn that she had sort of begun a romance with Ron Weasley 10 Harry Potter her best friend and future co brother in law Hermione became friends with Harry Potter after they as well as Ron Weasley took down a Mountain Troll together in their first year 3 They tended to get along very well on a day to day basis though Harry occasionally became annoyed by Hermione s nagging while she occasionally became annoyed by his lack of discipline and conviction in his schoolwork Their only notable row was over Hermione getting Harry s Firebolt confiscated in their third year which she felt it might be a trap Harry and Ron reconciled with Hermione after Hagrid scolded them for their treatment of her Harry and Hermione were quite similar in their dour brooding tendencies in times of trouble and often needed Ron s humour and levity to counterbalance their intense personalities Harry Hermione and Ron spent nearly all their time together during their years at Hogwarts and shortly afterwards Hermione led Harry through time travel and together they rescued Sirius Black and Buckbeak Hermione breaking the rules of using her Time Turner something she admitted was incredibly dangerous demonstrated the strength of her friendship with Harry 34 The following year Hermione was the only student who believed Harry when he told her he had not put his name in the Goblet of Fire and spent much of the Triwizard Tournament teaching Harry useful spells and trying to reconcile him and Ron 35 While Harry and Hermione typically argued less than Ron and Hermione they had the most philosophical and moral disagreements with one another Ron typically deferred to Harry s opinions on important decisions and tends to hold back when Hermione confronts Harry about them letting them battle it out For example Harry and Hermione fought about how best to deal with Dolores Umbridge when she infiltrated Hogwarts whether or not Sirius s judgement could be trusted whether or not Harry should have tried to use Occlumency to block out his mental link with Voldemort whether Dumbledore s past made him an unworthy leader and whether they should have pursued the Hallows or the Horcruxes Hermione expressed immense displeasure to Harry during the sixth year after he started obtaining better results than her at Potion by the help of the Half Blood Prince s potions book Harry tended to be dismissive of Hermione s opinions and could even grow angry when she tried to argue her point but many times realised later that she was right For example Harry was often dismissive of Hermione s insistence that all house elves deserve respect and kindness and was neglectful towards Kreacher because of his bigotry until he finally realised the horrifying nature of his enslavement Hermione protecting Harry demonstrating her willingness to put his best interests first While Harry tended to have more fun with Ron Hermione was consistently his place of refuge when others abandoned him from Ron s jealous withdrawal during the Triwizard Tournament to Harry s discovery of Dumbledore s past during the war Despite their differences Harry and Hermione tended to support one another at the expense of others when necessary Hermione repeatedly chose to help and support Harry in his fight against Voldemort regardless of personal cost Examples include breaking the laws regarding time travel in order to help him save Sirius teaching him defensive magic in preparation for the Triwizard Tournament blackmailing Rita Skeeter in order to give him a way to tell the public about Voldemort s return protecting him from torture by Dolores Umbridge and Obliviating her parents in order to go on the run with him She notably chose to support him even when Ron did not Smaller acts of friendship included helping him with homework and cheering him on at Quidditch games Harry was similarly protective and supportive of Hermione Much like Hermione Harry was often a place of refuge for Hermione when others leave her Harry often comforted Hermione and showed her kindness and care when she was upset On the occasion that Buckbeak the Hippogriff was executed Harry consoled her as she cries He was also quick to defend Hermione from Cho Chang Draco Malfoy and others who insulted her for her looks or parentage which showed his pride in her intellect on numerous occasions He consistently praised her intelligence and magical skills to teachers asked her for help in dangerous situations and defended her against bullies On one occasion he even choose to side with her over Ron when he was dating Lavender But he expressed outrage when Hermione went to Slughorn s party with Cormac McLaggen Harry also defended Hermione physically on instinct This showed his willingness to put her before himself as well as his unconditional brotherly love for her For example when Lupin turned into a werewolf and attacked Hermione and Harry in 1994 Harry shielded her from the danger Many people including Ron Cho Chang Viktor Krum Mrs Weasley have occasionally mistaken Harry and Hermione s relationship to be a romantic one given their closeness and expressions of physical affection such as kisses on the cheek staying by one another s bedsides when hurt or injured embracing each other and holding hands 35 75 Harry eventually explained to Ron that he and Hermione were like brother and sister 10 They shared similar upbringings as being only children raised in the Muggle world and showed each other unconditional love despite their many differences and disagreements During their time alone during the war Ron and Harry maintained a distance with Hermione mostly crying for Ron and Harry observing Ginny s dot at the Marauder s map They did exchange a comforting moment during their brief embrace after Harry visited his parent s grave 76 Hermione and Harry remained best friends into adulthood and eventually became co siblings in law when Hermione married Ron Weasley and Harry married Ginny Weasley Hermione was also the aunt and godmother of Harry s three children James Sirius Albus Severus and Lily Luna They were also coworkers for many years as employees of the Ministry of Magic in law enforcement It is interesting to note that Albus Dumbledore s final plan to defeat Lord Voldemort in which Harry would learn the story of the Deathly Hallows in time to use them against Voldemort revolved not only around Harry himself but Hermione as well Dumbledore knew that Harry was too passionate and angry to be able to keep from attempting to become Master of Death and so entrusted The Tales of Beedle the Bard to Hermione so that she would learn of the Hallows symbol first and would be able to caution and guide Harry down the path of reason Ginny Weasley her good friend and future sister in law Ginny Weasley was Hermione s best female friend and Ginny s confidante The two grew close when Hermione stayed in Ginny s room at The Burrow during her many summertime visits Ginny was the only one Hermione told about being asked to the Yule Ball by Viktor Krum 35 while Hermione was the only one who knew that Ginny had been learning to fly in secret for years 32 She also gave Ginny advice about dealing with her feelings for Harry advice that eventually led to the two dating 36 and eventually marrying Hermione comforted Ginny after an encounter with Dementors upset her in 1993 34 and after the death of her brother Fred in 1998 10 However Hermione would not have been afraid to stand up to Ginny when she felt that Ginny was wrong The two remained very close after the war and eventually became sisters in law when Hermione married Ron making her an aunt to Ginny s three children James Albus and Lily as well as being chosen to be godmother to Ginny s eldest son James and making Ginny Rose and Hugo s aunt and almost certainly Rose s godmother Neville Longbottom her friend Hermione was good friends with Neville Longbottom They met on the train to Hogwarts during their first year and she helped him search for his toad Trevor 3 Hermione helped Neville many times with their school work particularly with Potions as Professor Snape noted that she was often hissing instructions in his ear 34 In their fourth year Hermione noticed Neville s horrified reaction to witnessing the Cruciatus Curse be performed on a spider by Professor Alastor Moody actually Barty Crouch Jnr and shrieked for the teacher to stop That same year Neville asked Hermione to attend the Yule Ball with him as she had always been really nice to him though she had already agreed to accompany Viktor Krum 35 Hermione often fiercely defended Neville when others insulted him and her friendship and support as well as that of other D A members likely contributed to Neville gradually gaining self confidence and courage 10 Neville was obviously very fond of Hermione and appreciative of her kindness and all the help she had given him It was hinted that he spoke of her frequently to his grandmother Augusta Longbottom who seemed to already know a good deal about Hermione when they first met at Saint Mungo s in 1995 Following the war they kept in touch Luna Lovegood a good friend Although Hermione rarely saw eye to eye with Luna Lovegood due to their very different world views and beliefs the two became very good friends through Dumbledore s Army Hermione first met Luna on the Hogwarts Express in 1995 she insulted The Quibbler but backtracked when Luna told her that her father was the editor Hermione was frustrated with Luna s belief in all manner of things without proof or logical grounds but eventually simply accepted their differences telling Luna that her planned trip to Sweden in search of a Crumple Horned Snorkack sounded lovely 32 The following year Luna comforted Hermione when she was upset over her fight with Ron 36 Hermione was one of the five portraits Luna painted along with Harry Ron Ginny and Neville and hung from her bedroom ceiling the word friends linking them in gold writing When Xenophilius Lovegood attempted to turn Harry Ron and Hermione over to Death Eaters in exchange for his daughter s safety Hermione engineered their escape so that the Death Eaters saw Harry briefly thus ensuring that both Luna and her father were not harmed Despite disagreeing with Luna on many things herself Hermione defended her when others insulted her for example she tried to kick Ron for teasing Luna about Gurdyroots at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour and snapped at the portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black for calling Luna an oddity The two girls remained close friends in adulthood and saw each other regularly Luna may be one of the best female friends of Hermione along with Ginny as she was only seen with these girls during her school time at Hogwarts 10 Sirius Black her friend Hermione first learned about Sirius Black in 1993 when he escaped Azkaban The wizarding world at large knew of him as the wizard who murdered twelve Muggles and a wizard Peter Pettigrew with a single curse Very few knew of his affiliation with the Potters and those who did also believed that Sirius had betrayed James and Lily Potter to Voldemort by revealing their location at Godric s Hollow During the events at Hogwarts in 1993 Hermione along with Harry Ron and Lupin discovered that contrary to their previous beliefs Sirius Black had never committed the murders for which he had been incarcerated nor had he betrayed his closest friends The trio managed to save Sirius and Lupin from being subjected to the Dementor s Kiss at the hands of Severus Snape by firing three simultaneous Disarming Charms at him Snape was blasted off his feet and knocked unconscious allowing Harry Ron and Hermione to continue their interrogation of Sirius who later revealed that Pettigrew had disguised himself in his rat Animagus form for twelve years in order to escape justice and the wrath of Voldemort s remaining Death Eaters However upon exiting the Whomping Willow s secret passageway together Pettigrew shrewdly used Lupin s werewolf transformation as a distraction and escaped Sirius was soon apprehended and locked in Filius Flitwick s office to await the Dementor s Kiss Harry and Hermione would later use the latter s Time Turner to rescue Sirius who became deeply grateful to both of them In 1994 Hermione Harry and Ron visited Sirius at the cave off Hogsmeade village he was hiding in bringing him food Here they discussed the many mysteries that had occurred during that year the trio learning valuable pieces of information regarding the imprisonment of Barty Crouch Jnr After the events of the Third Task Sirius while in his Animagus form joined Hermione Ron and Molly Weasley at Harry s bedside each indicating their affections for the latter Hermione and Sirius would not meet again until the summer of 1995 at the Headquarters of the second Order of the Phoenix Sirius was obliged to remain in 12 Grimmauld Place for his own safety his innocence not yet recognised by the Ministry Sirius was rather disappointed when Harry was allowed to return to Hogwarts Hermione pointing out that he had probably been secretly wishing that Harry had been expelled from school so that they could both stay at Grimmauld Place and be outcasts together Hermione expressed an even deeper understanding of Sirius s emotions when she stated her opinion to Harry that Sirius was attempting to relive his happier school days through his godson Harry ignored this and became slightly agitated at the suggestion that Sirius might be guilty of such a crude selfish mentality However she severely disapproved of his indifferent and occasionally cruel treatment of his house elf Kreacher despite the fact that Kreacher initially appeared to be disgusted by her and addressed her as the Mudblood which Hermione often attributed to Kreacher being senile due to his old age She also thought that Sirius was attempting to live vicariously through her Harry and Ron when he encouraged them to form Dumbledore s Army but the two boys became angry and snapped at her when she expressed this belief Sirius was eventually killed by Bellatrix Lestrange in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries much to the dismay of his friends and loved ones Hermione was devastated by his death and often tried to provide comfort to Harry who had been even more deeply affected by the tragedy At the end of the Second Wizarding War Hermione became godmother to Harry s eldest son James Sirius whose first and middle name was derived from James Potter and Sirius Black respectively Hermione with Crookshanks Crookshanks was Hermione s large bandy legged half Kneazle ginger coloured pet cat since she bought him from the Magical Menagerie in Diagon Alley in 1993 She seemed to think he was gorgeous although no one else had wanted to buy him when he was still being sold at the Menagerie She was proud of his cleverness The latter proved to be quite true during the 1993 1994 school year 34 Crookshanks recognised that Hermione had left him at The Burrow before Bill and Fleur s wedding in 1997 10 most likely had been left in care of Mrs Weasley or Ginny but it is possible that they were reunited after the Second War given the deep care and affection they had for each other Lavender Brown her roommate and romantic rival Hermione s roommates at Hogwarts were fellow Gryffindors Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil as well as Fay Dunbar and another girl While Lavender and Parvati swiftly became best friends Hermione was not very close to either of them Although the girls did not dislike each other they had very different interests and sometimes clashed as a result For example Hermione scorned Divination Lavender and Parvati s favourite subject and accidentally upset Lavender with her clumsy attempt to comfort her over the death of her rabbit 34 Hermione was also angry with Lavender for doubting Harry Potter s assertion that Lord Voldemort had returned in 1995 and snapped at her about it Parvati Patil her roommate When Lavender began dating Ron Weasley she was very upset and confided in Harry about her feelings Once they broke up however Hermione chose to not display open affection towards Ron so Lavender s feelings would not get hurt She also came to Lavender s rescue during the Battle of Hogwarts blasting Fenrir Greyback away from her 10 Unfortunately Lavender was mortally wounded by Greyback and was already dead by the time Hermione reached her It can be assumed that Hermione was at least saddened by Lavenders death Hermione had a less tumultuous relationship with Parvati although the two were not close During Hermione s first year at Hogwarts she hugged Parvati after Harry caught the Snitch at a Quidditch game Parvati was noted to feel guilty after laughing at Ron s cruel teasing of Hermione in Transfiguration and the two discussed Hermione s attendance of the Slug Club Christmas party with Cormac McLaggen As Parvati looked positively agog at Hermione confiding in her 36 it can be assumed that Hermione seldom discussed personal matters with her room mates Cormac McLaggen Cormac McLaggen was a Gryffindor student one year above Hermione The two became acquainted in 1996 through the Slug Club of which they were both members though Hermione did not think highly of McLaggen When she overheard him insulting Ron and Ginny during Quidditch try outs Hermione struck him with the Confundus Charm undermining his abilities as a Keeper Later in the year when Hermione was furious with Ron for dating Lavender Brown she decided to attend Professor Slughorn s Christmas party with McLaggen because she knew Ron despised him McLaggen was apparently interested in Hermione as he escorted her to the party and was very forward with her romantically while there This as well as his tendency to boast about himself put Hermione off and she soon abandoned him for the company of Harry and Luna before leaving the party altogether to avoid him 36 It can be assumed that the party was the end of their interaction Cho Chang in her fifth year Hermione had a two sided history with Cho while Hermione offered Harry advice for making his relationship with Cho successful Cho thought that Hermione s friendship with Harry was romantic and got increasingly jealous of her since Harry spends so much time with her Hermione has no grudges for Cho however and was not angry at her when Harry told Hermione that Cho insulted her instead rather cross at Harry for messing up his own relationship When Harry arrives at the Room of Requirement with Ron and Hermione shortly after the Battle of Hogwarts all hard feelings seemed to have been forgotten or forgiven as Cho greeted Hermione in a friendly way probably since Cho had long broke up with Harry The two seemed to be on neutral terms Lord Voldemort her enemy Hermione first learned about Lord Voldemort the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time after reading about him sometime before she began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry During her first year she and Ron Weasley helped Harry Potter reach the Philosopher s Stone and protect it from Voldemort A year later Hermione after fully recovering from her Polyjuice mishap was shown T M Riddle s Diary by Harry At first enthusiastic that the book might have magical powers Hermione first came up with the theory that it was Tom Riddle who originally caught the Heir of Slytherin when the Chamber of Secrets had been opened fifty years prior She also correctly guessed that the Diary contained the answers to the Chamber s location how to open it and the true identity of Slytherin s monster Thinking that the Diary was written in invisible ink the attempted to use the spell Aparecium and then a Revealer on the object but to no effect Later on when Harry went to the trophy room to try to learn more about Tom Riddle he was accompanied by an interested Hermione When Ron compared Riddle to Percy in disgust mentioning the former as being Prefect Head Boy probably at the top of every class Hermione responded in a slightly hurt voice You say that like it s a bad thing Later on she also correctly deduced that Riddle had caught the wrong person and that it was some other monster not Hagrid s Acromantula Aragog that was killing people Later on after Harry mentioned hearing the voice again before the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff Hermione ran immediately to the Library to research where realised that Slytherin s monster was a Basilisk Tearing the page out of the book and putting it in her right hand she left the Library where she warned the first person she met Penelope Clearwater to look around corners with her mirror However both Hermione and Penelope were petrified by Salazar Slytherin s Basilisk which was controlled by Tom Riddle s memory In 1995 she learned that the Dark Lord had returned and supported Harry against the Ministry s denial and smear campaign She also fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries to prevent Voldemort from obtaining a vital prophecy but was severely injured and rendered unconscious In 1997 she left Hogwarts to help Harry and Ron find and destroy Voldemort s Horcruxes She personally destroyed Helga Hufflepuff s Cup using a Basilisk s fang She later witnessed Harry s defeat of Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts However Hermione made very little direct contact with Voldemort truly seeing him for the first time during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries Possibly the closest connection Hermione and Voldemort shared was through the former wearing Salazar Slytherin s Locket whilst travelling with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley in 1997 The Horcrux locket was worn by all three for regular though limited periods of time inadvertently allowing the portion of soul within to access the wearer s thoughts emotions and deepest fears The Horcrux had learned enough about Hermione to use hers and Harry s likenesses in emotionally torturing Ron reflecting Ron s deepest fears of Hermione preferring Harry to him Because the Horcrux had become so disconnected from the once whole soul of Tom Riddle the physically bodied Voldemort was not aware of any of these events nor of the information the Horcrux had gained dangling around the necks of Harry and his closest friends Although they had very little direct contact Hermione and Voldemort are sometimes similar both are model students who achieved outstanding grades in NEWTS Both were Prefects although Voldemort was Head Boy while Hermione skipped school during what would have been her seventh year due to political persecution preventing her from being Head Girl that year it is possible that Hermione became Head Girl when she went back to finish her seventh year after Voldemort s final destruction They both came from Muggle backgrounds but Voldemort was raised in an orphanage while Hermione was brought up in a loving Muggle family Bellatrix Lestrange a hated enemy Bellatrix Lestrange was one of Voldemort s most fanatically loyal followers Hermione initially knew her as one of the Death Eaters involved in torturing and permanently incapacitating Frank and Alice Longbottom though she also witnessed Bellatrix murder Sirius Black at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996 During the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor Bellatrix chose to torture Hermione who as a Muggle born Bellatrix felt was most dispensable though as a blood traitor Ron Weasley was a close second in order to discover where and how the trio had managed to acquire Godric Gryffindor s Sword During the interrogation Bellatrix used her knife to carve the word mudblood on Hermione s arm 74 as well as torturing her sadistically with the Cruciatus Curse 10 Hermione later used one of Bellatrix s hairs obtained in the skirmish to make Polyjuice Potion and break into the Lestrange Vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank She expressed disgust at having to use Bellatrix s wand knowing the crimes Bellatrix committed with it Hermione Ginny and Luna duelled against Bellatrix during the final battle but were made to stand aside by Molly Weasley who eventually killed Bellatrix herself avenging Frank and Alice Longbottom Sirius Black Nymphadora Tonks and Dobby the house elf in the process among others Draco Malfoy her school bully Draco Malfoy of an old and wealthy pure blood family with Death Eater ties was raised to believe in the inferiority of Muggle borns and thus treated Hermione with disdain This was probably exacerbated by Hermione s friendship with Harry and Ron who shared a strong enmity with Draco from virtually the moment they met and her beating Draco in school marks for which his father berated him 4 Draco frequently called Hermione the disparaging term Mudblood which usually set off the tempers of her friends and the entire Gryffindor Quidditch team when he first said it to her face in 1992 4 but Hermione tended to ignore Draco and urged Harry and Ron to do the same Occasionally she would snap back at him and in their third year she even slapped him when he mocked Rubeus Hagrid for being upset over the impending execution of Buckbeak for which Draco was largely responsible 34 In spite of his prejudice and dislike toward Hermione Draco was reluctant to confirm her identity when he was asked to do so by his parents and aunt Bellatrix in 1998 avoiding even looking at her As an adult sobered by his wartime experiences Draco was civil towards Hermione and her friends and friendly with her nephew Albus Potter 10 He even found the idea of taking orders from her during their ambush in 1981 of Delphini to be darkly humorous Draco s civility towards Hermione during this time was likely reinforced due to her being the Minister for Magic in Britain at the time and possibly due to her relations to Albus Potter the best friend of his own son Scorpius Pansy Parkinson Pansy Parkinson was more or less Hermione s polar opposite where Hermione was compassionate as seen when she founded SPEW independent and incredibly helpful to nearly anyone who needed it Pansy was petty and spiteful who mocked just about every non Slytherin student she encountered as well as Hagrid and was little more than one of Draco Malfoy s more sycophantic lackeys Pansy had a tendency to taunt and snipe at Hermione Harry and Ron at any given opportunity though Hermione rarely seemed more than slightly irritated by her comments the major exception to that most likely would have been Pansy s attempt to surrender Harry to Lord Voldemort shortly prior to the start of the Battle of Hogwarts Hermione had a scathing opinion of Pansy believing her to be be a cow and thicker than a concussed troll 32 Rita Skeeter While covering the Triwizard Tournament in Hermione s fourth year Daily Prophet journalist Rita Skeeter wrote a number of exaggerated and slanderous stories about Harry Potter and his friends including one that outed Rubeus Hagrid as a half giant Harry and Hermione angrily confronted Rita about this After Hermione insulted her Rita published another article that portrayed Hermione as manipulative and ambitious claiming that she was toying with the emotions of both Harry Potter and Viktor Krum This resulted in Hermione receiving several letters of hate mail including a few Howlers and at least one envelope filled with bubotuber pus Hermione became obsessed with getting back at Rita and uncovering how she was getting all of her information Finally near the end of the school year Hermione realised that Rita Skeeter was an unregistered Animagus She caught Rita in her beetle form attempting to eavesdrop on Harry in the Hospital Wing after the Third Task Hermione sealed her inside a small bottle Hermione blackmailed Rita into giving up writing for one year otherwise her unregistered status would be revealed As the penalties are apparently quite severe Rita had no choice but to comply When the Ministry of Magic began using the Daily Prophet in its smear campaign against Harry Hermione was again able to blackmail Rita this time into writing an article for The Quibbler that would allow Harry to tell his side of the story After her one year punishment was over Rita went back to writing with as much enthusiasm and as little scruples as she had before although it s unknown if she ever crossed Hermione again Given her notable lack of commentary regarding Hermione during the 2014 Quidditch World Cup in Egypt it is likely that Rita remained extremely wary of Hermione s wrath 19 years following her being blackmailed by the prodigious witch Dumbledore s Army her allies Dumbledore s Army was essentially Hermione s brainchild though she co founded it with Ron and Harry during the 1995 1996 school year After Dolores Umbridge informed her Defence Against the Dark Arts students that they would not be using any magic claiming a theoretical education would suffice a furious Hermione fearful of being ill equipped to deal with the reborn Lord Voldemort and the upcoming O W L s conceived of the organisation as a means of allowing any student interested in actually practising defensive magic to do so Though the secret classes were taught by Harry Hermione arranged the initial meeting at the Hog s Head created the DA s method of covert communication and jinxed their member list to reveal any betrayal All of the DA members grew closer over the course of the year with the exceptions of Marietta Edgecombe who betrayed the DA to Umbridge and later Zacharias Smith who deserted them as evidenced by their reunion in 1997 and their enthusiasm in supporting Harry and mobilising against the invading Death Eaters during the Battle of Hogwarts Moreover the DA truly cemented Hermione s friendships with Luna Lovegood and Neville Longbottom who were the only members aside from Ginny Weasley to fight alongside Hermione Harry and Ron at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Battle of the Astronomy Tower The original Order of the Phoenix her allies Hermione first heard about the Order of the Phoenix in 1995 when she Harry and Ron spent several weeks at the Order s headquarters Through her time at Grimmauld Place Hermione got to know Alastor Moody the most famous Auror of modern times known for rounding up several Death Eaters after the First Wizarding War and for his growing paranoia He and Hermione fought together in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and later in the Battle of the Seven Potters where Moody was killed by Voldemort s own hand Hermione like the rest of the Order was shocked and horrified by the death of such a skilled Auror the consummate survivor 10 and disgusted by Mundungus Fletcher s desertion Hermione who had known Fletcher as a petty criminal who had stolen a number the Black family heirlooms shortly after Sirius Black s death aside from being a member of the Order took part in interrogating Fletcher when she Harry and Ron realised Salazar Slytherin s Locket had been among the items stolen from Grimmauld Place Hermione had great respect for Kingsley Shacklebolt a skilled Auror and eventual Minister for Magic who was known as Royal on Potterwatch and who saved countless lives including Hermione Ron and Harry s when he sent his Patronus to warn the attendees of Bill and Fleur s wedding that the Ministry had fallen and with it the protections surrounding The Burrow Another member of the Order responsible for saving the trio was Aberforth Dumbledore Albus younger brother Though Hermione Harry and Ron had known him for some time as the owner of the Hog s Head Pub they finally met him in 1998 just before the Battle of Hogwarts when he just barely managed to get them out a trap set by Death Eaters Prior to that he sent Dobby to rescue them along with Dean Thomas Luna Lovegood Garrick Ollivander and Griphook the Goblin from the Malfoy Manor as it turned out Aberforth had acquired Sirius Black s two way mirror from Mundungus Fletcher and been keeping an eye out for Harry Nymphadora Tonks a funny Metamorphmagus witch who had become a good friend of Hermione s died along with her husband and fellow member of the Order Remus Lupin during the Battle of Hogwarts As their son Ted Lupin was Harry s godson and was also dating Hermione s niece Victoire by 2017 it s likely Hermione remained quite close to him Albus Dumbledore her former headmaster As with most aspects of the wizarding world Hermione read about Albus Dumbledore shortly after learning that she was a witch Hermione on her very first train journey revealed she wanted to be in Gryffindor because it was the house that Dumbledore belonged to She first met the Hogwarts headmaster during her her first year at the school in 1991 and quickly came to respect Dumbledore s immense power and seemingly infinite wisdom Although Dumbledore was not as close with her as he was with Harry Potter he showed great insight into her character very early on She was one of only three students Dumbledore bequeathed a personal item as he believed her to be along with Ron Weasley trustworthy of accompanying Harry on his mission to destroy Voldemort s Horcruxes He respected her intellect perspicacity and level headedness admitting to Harry that he had counted on Hermione to keep things in perspective when the trio finally discovered the existence of the Deathly Hallows Hermione was devastated when Dumbledore was killed and visited his portrait with Harry and Ron after the Battle of Hogwarts to determine the fate of the Hallows Rubeus Hagrid her friend and professor Rubeus Hagrid was the gamekeeper and Care of Magical Creatures professor at Hogwarts as well as a member of the Order of the Phoenix during the First and Second Wizarding Wars Since Hagrid had met Harry Potter prior to the start of Hermione s first year at Hogwarts Hermione grew closer to Hagrid as her friendship with Harry developed eventually coming to visit him in his hut regularly with Harry and Ron Weasley In their second year Hagrid comforted Hermione when she was called a a filthy little mudblood by Draco Malfoy Though she disapproved of Hagrid s penchant for collecting dangerous pets she tended to more pro actively support him in his efforts to care for them than Harry and Ron as when Hagrid was attempting to appeal the execution of Buckbeak and raise his half brother Grawp In turn it was Hagrid who encouraged Ron and Harry to re think their treatment of Hermione when the three had a brief falling out over Hermione getting Harry s new Firebolt confiscated in their third year When Dolores Umbridge threatened Hagrid s job during the 1995 1996 school year Hermione advised him to teach only materials related to their O W Ls so as not to give Umbridge any excuse to fire him and worked tirelessly to keep him on track Hagrid remained close to the trio throughout their time at Hogwarts and fought various battles in the course of the Second Wizarding War In 2017 Harry s sons planned to meet Hagrid in his hut for tea soon after arriving at school and it s very likely that Hermione and Ron s daughter would have been joining them Remus Lupin her professor and friend Hermione was among the students who were very impressed by Remus Lupin s teaching in 1993 when he was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Hermione deduced he was a werewolf during the school year yet chose to keep it a secret in order to respect his privacy Towards the end of the year however Lupin admitted that he was a werewolf to Harry Ron and Hermione whilst in the Shrieking Shack Following the events in this dilapidated building Lupin became fully prepared to help Sirius Black kill Peter Pettigrew the wizard who betrayed James and Lily Potter to Voldemort However thanks to Harry s intervention they chose not to commit the murder inadvertently allowing Pettigrew to escape Lupin had referred to Hermione as the cleverest witch of her age he had ever seen before to this Hermione meanwhile did not concern herself with Lupin s lycanthropy she judged him only by his good nature and the content of his character Hermione met Lupin again in 1995 at the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix She and Lupin both fought against the Death Eaters during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996 and survived despite Hermione being side swiped by Dolohov s curse They also fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of the Seven Potters alongside both emerging alive and relatively unscathed on the two occasions Hermione was pleased to learn that Lupin had married Nymphadora Tonks before the Battle of the Seven Potters began and became even more joyful at the news of Lupin s son Ted Lupin being born joining in on the celebratory festivities at Shell Cottage Hermione was devastated by Lupin s and Tonks deaths in 1998 becoming friendly with their orphaned son Teddy Lupin later on in life Minerva McGonagall her Head of House and professor Professor Minerva McGonagall took a shine to Hermione from the first class she had with her granting the first year student in her house one of her rare smiles when Hermione successfully transfigured a match into a needle early on in the lesson and long before any other student She had high expectations for Hermione and was thus disappointed in her when Hermione claimed she tried to fight the troll that entered the school in 1991 on her own in order to cover up for Harry and Ron Whenever Hermione and her friends would get into trouble McGonagall almost inevitably looked to Hermione to be the most sensible one 3 McGonagall was noticeably upset when Hermione was Petrified in 1993 even granting Harry and Ron permission to skip a class so they could visit Hermione in the hospital wing 4 The following school year she helped arrange for Hermione to be granted a Time Turner to take extra classes 34 When the professor was injured with four Stunning Spells in 1996 Hermione was very upset and worried for her 32 Hermione seemed to regard her head of house as a role model while Professor McGonagall in spite of her sternness was obviously quite fond of Hermione and expected great things of her Later after McGonagall became headmistress of Hogwarts and Hermione became a member of the Ministry of Magic McGonagall granted her permission to use notes left to the Hogwarts Archives written by Albus Dumbledore in her re translation of The Tales of Beedle the Bard demonstrating McGonagall s trust in her former pupil Severus Snape her professor Severus Snape was the Potions Master during most of Hermione s time at Hogwarts He was also the Head of Slytherin House and tended to openly show preferential treatment for the students of his own house while being quick to criticise and deduct points from Gryffindor students He was particularly unpleasant towards the trio and regularly punished and verbally assaulted Harry and Ron for their poor to mediocre performances in his class He could not do the same to Hermione as she was the best student in the year and instead mocked her for things like being an insufferable know it all 34 once even snidely insulting the size of Hermione s teeth 35 Despite his pre existing dislike for Gryffindor 10 Snape s treatment of Hermione likely had more to do with her close friendship with Harry Despite this Hermione was still seen to defend Snape on occasion when Harry and Ron blamed him for evil deeds which occurred in Hogwarts like setting the troll in the dungeon and trying to steal the Philosopher s Stone in Harry s first year In her fifth year she defended Snape while Ron expressed distrust of him citing the number of times they were wrong about Snape wanting to harm them After Dumbledore s death she like many believed that Snape was a coward who killed a man who trusted him more than anyone It is unknown exactly how she reacted to learning of Snape s true motives and allegiance but given her personality it is highly likely that she came to both forgive her former Professor s cruelty and even admire him for his bravery Later in an alternative timeline where she and Snape led the resistance against Voldemort after Harry Potter s death Hermione seemed to respect her former teacher and after discovering that in the mainstream reality Snape had perished she expressed her sorrow Dolores Umbridge her former professor and enemy Dolores Umbridge was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor by the Ministry of Magic in 1995 She was a sadistic woman who enjoyed punishing and torturing students using the Black Quill most notably when she forced Harry Potter to carve I must not tell lies into the back of his own hand Umbridge was as obsessed with blood status as the Death Eaters and had a particular hatred of what she called half breeds Hermione like most of the students and staff at Hogwarts hated Umbridge Hermione was one of the first to pick up on the true motives behind Umbridge s appointment at the magical school In turn Umbridge was not too fond of Hermione who was not only Muggle born but was also probably far too perceptive for her liking as well as being outspokenly opposed to a purely theoretical defensive magical education Despite this Umbridge could not help but be impressed however reluctantly when Hermione effortlessly quoted a phrase from Defensive Magical Theory When Umbridge planned to use Veritaserum and then the Cruciatus Curse on Harry Hermione was the one who came up with the lie that led to them venturing into the Forbidden Forest and Umbridge eventually being dragged away by a herd of offended centaurs Hermione next met Umbridge a second time at the Ministry of Magic in 1997 when Hermione was disguised as Mafalda Hopkirk through the usage of Polyjuice Potion Umbridge was at the time interrogating Mudblood witches and wizards prior to sending them to Azkaban Harry stunned Umbridge and retrieved Salazar Slytherin s Locket one of Voldemort s Horcruxes which Umbridge had taken from Mundungus Fletcher and was attempting to pass off as a family heirloom and proof of her relation to the Selwyn family Hermione replaced the locket by duplicating it with the Geminio spell so Umbridge would not know that it had been taken from her The trio proceeded to free all the Muggle Borns awaiting interrogation Suffice it to say that Umbridge personified everything that Hermione detested and loathed in Wizarding society including but not limited to racial prejudice sadism malicious misuse of power authoritarianism and pure blood supremacy Septima Vector her Arithmancy professor Hermione also had a good relationship with her Arithmancy Professor Septima Vector Many students disliked Vector because of her strictness However Hermione said Arithmancy was her favourite subject at Hogwarts She also never complained about Vector s strictness During her third year Hermione joined her class and used a time turner to get to one of the lessons 77 Then in her fourth year Hermione and the other students got no homework from Septima Vector on the first day of term 78 and she adamantly refused to skive Arithmancy 58 Rowling took Hermione s name from William Shakespeare s The Winter s Tale 79 saying that she wanted it to be unusual since if fewer girls shared her name fewer girls would get teased for it 79 Rowling s knowledge and interest in Greek mythology may have also influenced her choice in regards to Hermione s name In 1988 Rowling wrote a short essay about her time studying classics entitled What was the Name of that Nymph Again or Greek and Roman Studies Recalled it was published by the University of Exeter s journal Pegasus 80 The name Hermione is derived from Hermes who was the messenger of the Greek gods as well as the god of wit eloquence and quick thinking Hermione is the female derivative of Hermes a messenger god known for his sharp wit and ability to transition between worlds Quite fittingly Hermione transitioned between the Muggle and wizarding worlds delivered information and was pretty sharp witted herself Hermione in her sixth year Hermione is also the name of another figure from Greek mythology who was the princess of Sparta and the only daughter of Helen of Troy and King Menelaus The name also appears in Jean Baptiste Lully s play Cadmus et Hermione based on the story of the goddess of harmony Harmonia who married the founder of Thebes In order to ensure that fans could correctly pronounce Hermione s name a scene was created between Hermione and Viktor Krum in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in which they discuss the correct pronunciation however the closest Krum got was Herm own ninny 81 In the will of Albus Dumbledore Hermione s middle name was listed as Jean however in previous interviews Rowling had stated that her middle name was Jane Rowling cleared this up in a later interview by stating that she had decided that she did not want Hermione to share a middle name with Professor Umbridge and thus changed it to Jean which is a female variant of the name John meaning God is gracious 82 Granger is another word for farmer specifically it was the title of a farm bailiff who oversaw the collection of rent and taxes from the barns of a feudal lord It is a surname of English and French origin derived from the Anglo Norman grainger and the French grangier both of which come from Latin granica meaning granary It recalls Hermione s Muggle roots Her original last name was Puckle but Rowling later decided this didn t suit her character Her initials are the chemical symbol for Mercury another name for Hermes 83 The reason of choosing such an uncommon name as Hermione for the character is because according to Rowling she did not bear getting any child mocked because of sharing a name with an insufferable know it all such as Hermione

has claimed that she loosely based Hermione at the age of eleven on herself at the same age though an exaggerated version Rowling has gone on to say that Hermione Harry and Ron are all a bit like different parts of my personality as well as her favourite characters along with Rubeus Hagrid Albus Dumbledore Fred and George Weasley and Luna Lovegood 89 and that Hermione and Dumbledore were the most useful characters for exposition 90 She also identified Hermione as the most brilliant of her group of friends and confirmed that Harry needs her badly 98 Rowling has also said that she considers Hermione to be a very strong female character as well as the brightest character 99 Rowling has also stated that from a feminist point of view she is very proud of Hermione In her words Hermione does not play the game in refusing to sacrifice parts of herself as she grows from a girl to a woman Hermione never makes Ron feel better by pretending to be less than she is she always preserves who she is and waits for Ron to catch up In general Rowling regards her as a heroine but isn t sexy nor entirely sexless but a real girl Rowling admitted in an interview conducted by Emma Watson for the magazine Wonderland in February of 2014 that with hindsight she initially had some second thoughts on the suitability of Ron as a partner for Hermione and believes that in some ways Harry might have made a better romantic partner for her She went on to say that she found the attraction itself plausible but that the combative side of it might cause problems in an adult relationship as there was too much fundamental incompatibility However according to Rowling they could probably be alright with a bit of marriage counselling as Ron needed to work on his self esteem issues while Hermione needed to learn to be less critical She concluded with the statement that just like herself the uptight Hermione had a real weakness for a funny man Ultimately Rowling stated she had no regrets putting them together and stated the two balanced each other out and truly love one another 100 Armando Dippet Albus Dumbledore Barberus Bragge Bertie Bott Carlotta Pinkstone Dzou Yen Falco Aesalon

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest,Mount Everest known locally as Sagarmāthā a in Nepal and Qomolangma b in Tibet is Earth s highest mountain above sea level It lies in the Mahalangur Himal sub range of the Himalayas and marks part of the China Nepal border at its summit 4 Its height was most recently measured in 2020 by Chinese and Nepali authorities as 8 848 86 m 29 031 ft 8 1 2 in 5 6 Mount Everest attracts many climbers including highly experienced mountaineers There are two main climbing routes one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal known as the standard route and the other from the north in Tibet While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness weather and wind as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall As of May 2024 340 people have died on Everest Over 200 bodies remain on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous conditions 7 8 Climbers typically ascend only part of Mount Everest s elevation as the mountain s full elevation is measured from the geoid which approximates sea level The closest sea to Mount Everest s summit is the Bay of Bengal almost 700 km 430 mi away To approximate a climb of the entire height of Mount Everest one would need to start from this coastline a feat accomplished by Tim Macartney Snape s team in 1990 Climbers usually begin their ascent from base camps above 5 000 m 16 404 ft The amount of elevation climbed from below these camps varies On the Tibetan side most climbers drive directly to the North Base Camp On the Nepalese side climbers generally fly into Kathmandu then Lukla and trek to the South Base Camp making the climb from Lukla to the summit about 6 000 m 20 000 ft in elevation gain The first recorded efforts to reach Everest s summit were made by British mountaineers As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time the British made several attempts on the North Ridge route from the Tibetan side After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7 000 m 22 966 ft on the North Col the 1922 expedition on its first summit attempt marked the first time a human had climbed above 8 000 m 26 247 ft and it also pushed the North Ridge route up to 8 321 m 27 300 ft On the 1924 expedition George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned sparking debate as to whether they were the first to reach the top Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first documented ascent of Everest in 1953 using the Southeast Ridge route Norgay had reached 8 595 m 28 199 ft the previous year as a member of the 1952 Swiss expedition The Chinese mountaineering team of Wang Fuzhou Gonpo and Qu Yinhua made the first reported ascent of the peak from the North Ridge on 25 May 1960 9 Mount Everest s Nepali Sanskrit name is Sagarmāthā IAST transcription or Sagar Matha 10 सगर म थ sʌɡʌrmatʰa lit goddess of the sky 11 12 which means the head in the great blue sky being derived from सगर sagar meaning sky and म थ māthā meaning head 13 The Tibetan name for Everest is Qomolangma ཇ མ ག ང མ lit holy mother The name was first recorded in a Chinese transcription in the 1721 Kangxi Atlas issued during the reign of Qing Emperor Kangxi it first appeared in the West in 1733 as Tchoumour Lancma on a map prepared by the French geographer D Anville and based on Kangxi Atlas 14 The Tibetan name is also popularly romanised as Chomolungma and in Wylie as Jo mo glang ma 19 The official Chinese transcription is 珠穆朗玛峰 t 珠穆朗瑪峰 or Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng in pinyin While other Chinese names have been used historically including Shèngmǔ Fēng t 聖母峰 s 圣母峰 lit holy mother peak these names were largely phased out after the Chinese Ministry of Internal Affairs issued a decree to adopt a sole name in May 1952 20 The British geographic survey of 1849 attempted to preserve local names when possible e g Kangchenjunga and Dhaulagiri However Andrew Waugh the British Surveyor General of India claimed that he could not find a commonly used local name and that his search for one had been hampered by the Nepalese and Tibetan policy of exclusion of foreigners Waugh argued that because there were many local names it would be difficult to favour one name over all others he therefore decided that Peak XV should be named after British surveyor Sir George Everest his predecessor as Surveyor General of India 21 22 23 Everest himself opposed the honour and told the Royal Geographical Society in 1857 that Everest could neither be written in Hindi nor pronounced by the native of India Despite Everest s objections Waugh s proposed name prevailed and the Royal Geographical Society officially adopted the name Mount Everest in 1865 21 24 The modern pronunciation of Everest ˈɛvərɪst 25 is different from Sir George s pronunciation of his surname ˈiːvrɪst EEV rist 26 In the late 19th century many European cartographers incorrectly believed that a native name for the mountain was Gaurishankar a mountain between Kathmandu and Everest 27 In 1802 the British began the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India to fix among other things the locations heights and names of the world s highest mountains Starting in southern India the survey teams moved northward using giant theodolites each weighing 500 kg 1 100 lb and requiring 12 men to carry to measure heights as accurately as possible They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s but Nepal was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of their intentions Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were denied 21 The British were forced to continue their observations from Terai a region south of Nepal which is parallel to the Himalayas Conditions in Terai were difficult because of torrential rains and malaria Three survey officers died from malaria while two others had to retire because of failing health 21 Nonetheless in 1847 the British continued the survey and began detailed observations of the Himalayan peaks from observation stations up to 240 km 150 mi distant Weather restricted work to the last three months of the year In November 1847 Andrew Scott Waugh the British Surveyor General of India made several observations from the Sawajpore station at the east end of the Himalayas Kangchenjunga was then considered the highest peak in the world and with interest he noted a peak beyond it about 230 km 140 mi away John Armstrong one of Waugh s subordinates also saw the peak from a site farther west and called it peak b Waugh would later write that the observations indicated that peak b was higher than Kangchenjunga but closer observations were required for verification The following year Waugh sent a survey official back to Terai to make closer observations of peak b but clouds thwarted his attempts 21 In 1849 Waugh dispatched James Nicolson to the area who made two observations from Jirol 190 km 120 mi away Nicolson then took the largest theodolite and headed east obtaining over 30 observations from five different locations with the closest being 174 km 108 mi from the peak 21 Nicolson retreated to Patna on the Ganges to perform the necessary calculations based on his observations His raw data gave an average height of 9 200 m 30 200 ft for peak b but this did not consider light refraction which distorts heights However the number clearly indicated that peak b was higher than Kangchenjunga Nicolson contracted malaria and was forced to return home without finishing his calculations Michael Hennessy one of Waugh s assistants had begun designating peaks based on Roman numerals with Kangchenjunga named Peak IX Peak b now became known as Peak XV 21 In 1852 stationed at the survey headquarters in Dehradun Radhanath Sikdar an Indian mathematician and surveyor from Bengal was the first to identify Everest as the world s highest peak using trigonometric calculations based on Nicolson s measurements 30 An official announcement that Peak XV was the highest was delayed for several years as the calculations were repeatedly verified Waugh began work on Nicolson s data in 1854 and along with his staff spent almost two years working on the numbers having to deal with the problems of light refraction barometric pressure and temperature over the vast distances of the observations Finally in March 1856 he announced his findings in a letter to his deputy in Calcutta Kangchenjunga was declared to be 8 582 m 28 156 ft while Peak XV was given the height of 8 840 m 29 002 ft Waugh concluded that Peak XV was most probably the highest in the world 21 Peak XV measured in feet was calculated to be exactly 29 000 ft 8 839 2 m high but was publicly declared to be 29 002 ft 8 839 8 m in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of 29000 ft was nothing more than a rounded estimate 31 Waugh is sometimes playfully credited with being the first person to put two feet on top of Mount Everest 32 In 1856 Andrew Waugh announced Everest then known as Peak XV as 8 840 m 29 002 ft high after several years of calculations based on observations made by the Great Trigonometrical Survey 33 From 1952 to 1954 the Survey of India using triangulation methods determined that the height of Everest was 8 847 73 m 29 028 ft 34 In 1975 it was subsequently reaffirmed by a Chinese measurement of 8 848 13 m 29 029 30 ft 35 In both cases the snow cap not the rock head was measured The 8 848 m 29 029 ft height given was officially recognised by Nepal and China 36 Nepal planned a new survey in 2019 to determine if the April 2015 Nepal earthquake affected the height of the mountain 37 In May 1999 an American Everest expedition directed by Bradford Washburn anchored a GPS unit into the highest bedrock A rock head elevation of 8 850 m 29 035 ft and a snow ice elevation 1 m 3 ft higher were obtained via this device 38 Although as of 2001 it has not been officially recognised by Nepal 39 this figure is widely quoted Geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 see 21st century surveys surveys 40 In 1955 a detailed photogrammetric map at a scale of 1 50 000 of the Khumbu region including the south side of Mount Everest was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition which also attempted Lhotse In the late 1980s an even more detailed topographic map of the Everest area was made under the direction of Bradford Washburn using extensive aerial photography 41 On 9 October 2005 after several months of measurement and calculation the Chinese Academy of Sciences and State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping announced the height of Everest as 8 844 43 m 29 017 16 ft with accuracy of 0 21 m 8 3 in claiming it was the most accurate and precise measurement to date 42 This height is based on the highest point of rock and not the snow and ice covering it The Chinese team measured a snow ice depth of 3 5 m 11 ft 35 which is in agreement with a net elevation of 8 848 m 29 029 ft An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height 8 844 m China or the snow height 8 848 m Nepal In 2010 both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8 848 m and Nepal recognises China s claim that the rock height of Everest is 8 844 m 43 On 8 December 2020 it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is 8 848 86 metres 29 031 7 ft 44 45 It is thought that the plate tectonics of the Main Himalayan Thrust and related faults which form the convergent boundary between the Eurasian Plate and Indian Plate are adding to the height and moving the summit northeastwards Two accounts suggest the rates of change are 4 mm 0 16 in per year vertically and 3 to 6 mm 0 12 to 0 24 in per year horizontally 38 46 but another account mentions more lateral movement 27 mm or 1 1 in 47 and even shrinkage has been suggested 48 The summit of Everest is the point at which Earth s surface reaches the greatest distance above sea level Several other mountains are sometimes claimed to be the tallest mountains on Earth Mauna Kea in Hawaii is tallest when measured from its base note 4 it rises over 10 200 m 33 464 6 ft from its base on the mid ocean floor but only attains 4 205 m 13 796 ft above sea level By the same measure of base to summit Denali also called Mount McKinley in Alaska is taller than Everest as well note 4 Despite its height above sea level of only 6 190 m 20 308 ft Denali sits atop a sloping plain with elevations from 300 to 900 m 980 to 2 950 ft yielding a height above base in the range of 5 300 to 5 900 m 17 400 to 19 400 ft a commonly quoted figure is 5 600 m 18 400 ft 49 50 By comparison reasonable base elevations for Everest range from 4 200 m 13 800 ft on the south side to 5 200 m 17 100 ft on the Tibetan Plateau yielding a height above base in the range of 3 650 to 4 650 m 11 980 to 15 260 ft 41 The summit of Chimborazo in Ecuador is 2 168 m 7 113 ft farther from Earth s centre 6 384 4 km or 3 967 1 mi than that of Everest 6 382 3 km 3 965 8 mi because the Earth bulges at the equator 51 This is despite Chimborazo having a peak of 6 268 m 20 564 3 ft above sea level versus Mount Everest s 8 848 m 29 028 9 ft Many of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest for example Lhotse 8 516 m 27 940 ft Nuptse 7 855 m 25 771 ft Changtse 7 580 m 24 870 ft and Khumbutse 6 636 m 21 772 ft On the southwest side a major feature in the lower areas is the Khumbu icefall and glacier an obstacle to climbers on those routes but also to the base camps Geologists have subdivided the rocks comprising Mount Everest into three units called formations 52 53 Each formation is separated from the other by low angle faults called detachments along which they have been thrust southward over each other From the summit of Mount Everest to its base these rock units are the Qomolangma Formation the North Col Formation and the Rongbuk Formation The Qomolangma Formation also known as the Jolmo Lungama Formation 54 runs from the summit to the top of the Yellow Band about 8 600 m 28 200 ft above sea level It consists of greyish to dark grey or white parallel laminated and bedded Ordovician limestone interlayered with subordinate beds of recrystallised dolomite with argillaceous laminae and siltstone Gansser first reported finding microscopic fragments of crinoids in this limestone 55 56 Later petrographic analysis of samples of the limestone from near the summit revealed them to be composed of carbonate pellets and finely fragmented remains of trilobites crinoids and ostracods Other samples were so badly sheared and recrystallised that their original constituents could not be determined A thick white weathering thrombolite bed that is 60 m 200 ft thick comprises the foot of the Third Step and base of the summit pyramid of Everest This bed which crops out starting about 70 m 230 ft below the summit of Mount Everest consists of sediments trapped bound and cemented by the biofilms of micro organisms especially cyanobacteria in shallow marine waters The Qomolangma Formation is broken up by several high angle faults that terminate at the low angle normal fault the Qomolangma Detachment This detachment separates it from the underlying Yellow Band The lower five metres of the Qomolangma Formation overlying this detachment are very highly deformed 52 53 57 The bulk of Mount Everest between 7 000 and 8 600 m 23 000 and 28 200 ft consists of the North Col Formation of which the Yellow Band forms the upper part between 8 200 to 8 600 m 26 900 to 28 200 ft The Yellow Band consists of intercalated beds of Middle Cambrian diopside epidote bearing marble which weathers a distinctive yellowish brown and muscovite biotite phyllite and semischist Petrographic analysis of marble collected from about 8 300 m 27 200 ft found it to consist as much as five per cent of the ghosts of recrystallised crinoid ossicles The upper five metres of the Yellow Band lying adjacent to the Qomolangma Detachment is badly deformed A 5 40 cm 2 0 15 7 in thick fault breccia separates it from the overlying Qomolangma Formation 52 53 57 The remainder of the North Col Formation exposed between 7 000 to 8 200 m 23 000 to 26 900 ft on Mount Everest consists of interlayered and deformed schist phyllite and minor marble Between 7 600 and 8 200 m 24 900 and 26 900 ft the North Col Formation consists chiefly of biotite quartz phyllite and chlorite biotite phyllite intercalated with minor amounts of biotite sericite quartz schist Between 7 000 and 7 600 m 23 000 and 24 900 ft the lower part of the North Col Formation consists of biotite quartz schist intercalated with epidote quartz schist biotite calcite quartz schist and thin layers of quartzose marble These metamorphic rocks appear to be the result of the metamorphism of Middle to Early Cambrian deep sea flysch composed of interbedded mudstone shale clayey sandstone calcareous sandstone graywacke and sandy limestone The base of the North Col Formation is a regional low angle normal fault called the Lhotse detachment 52 53 57 Below 7 000 m 23 000 ft the Rongbuk Formation underlies the North Col Formation and forms the base of Mount Everest It consists of sillimanite K feldspar grade schist and gneiss intruded by numerous sills and dikes of leucogranite ranging in thickness from 1 cm to 1 500 m 0 4 in to 4 900 ft 53 58 These leucogranites are part of a belt of Late Oligocene Miocene intrusive rocks known as the Higher Himalayan leucogranite They formed as the result of partial melting of Paleoproterozoic to Ordovician high grade metasedimentary rocks of the Higher Himalayan Sequence about 20 to 24 million years ago during the subduction of the Indian Plate 59 Mount Everest consists of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks that have been faulted southward over continental crust composed of Archean granulites of the Indian Plate during the Cenozoic collision of India with Asia 60 61 62 Current interpretations argue that the Qomolangma and North Col formations consist of marine sediments that accumulated within the continental shelf of the northern passive continental margin of India before it collided with Asia The Cenozoic collision of India with Asia subsequently deformed and metamorphosed these strata as it thrust them southward and upward 63 64 The Rongbuk Formation consists of a sequence of high grade metamorphic and granitic rocks that were derived from the alteration of high grade metasedimentary rocks During the collision of India with Asia these rocks were thrust downward and to the north as they were overridden by other strata heated metamorphosed and partially melted at depths of over 15 to 20 kilometres 9 3 to 12 4 mi below sea level and then forced upward to surface by thrusting towards the south between two major detachments 65 Mount Everest is rising by about 2 mm per year 66 In respect of the recognition of the highest rocks on the planet as fossiliferous marine limestone the Ordovician Rocks of Mount Everest were included by the International Union of Geological Sciences IUGS in its assemblage of 100 geological heritage sites around the world in a listing published in October 2022 The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as a key place with geological elements and or processes of international scientific relevance used as a reference and or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history 67 There is very little native flora or fauna on Everest A type of moss grows at 6 480 metres 21 260 ft on Mount Everest and it may be the highest altitude plant species 68 An alpine cushion plant called Arenaria is known to grow below 5 500 metres 18 000 ft in the region 69 According to the study based on satellite data from 1993 to 2018 vegetation is expanding in the Everest region Researchers have found plants in areas that were previously deemed bare 70 A minute black jumping spider of the genus Euophrys has been found at elevations as high as 6 700 metres 22 000 ft 71 possibly making it the highest confirmed non microscopic permanent resident on Earth Another Euophrys species E everestensis has been found at 5 030 metres 16 500 ft and may feed on insects that have been blown there by the wind 71 There is a high likelihood of microscopic life at even higher altitudes The bar headed goose migrates over the Himalayas and have been seen flying at the higher altitudes of the mountain 72 In 1953 George Lowe part of the expedition of Tenzing and Hillary said that he saw bar headed geese flying over Everest s summit 73 Another bird species the chough have been spotted as high as the South Col at 7 906 m 25 938 ft 74 and yellow billed choughs have been seen as high as 7 900 m 25 919 ft 72 Yaks are often used to haul gear for Mount Everest climbs They can haul around 100 kg 220 pounds have thick fur and large lungs 69 Other animals in the region include the Himalayan tahr which is sometimes the prey of the snow leopard 75 The Himalayan black bear can be found up to about 4 300 metres 14 000 ft and the red panda is also present in the region 76 One expedition found a surprising range of species in the region including a pika and ten new species of ants 77 From the Nepalese side Everest is protected as part of Sagarmatha National Park 78 while from the Chinese side the mountain is protected as part of Qomolangma National Nature Reserve 79 Mount Everest has an ice cap climate Köppen EF with all months averaging well below freezing note 5 The base camp for Everest expeditions based out of Nepal is located by Khumbu Glacier which is rapidly thinning and destabilizing due to climate change making it unsafe for climbers As recommended by the committee formed by Nepal s government to facilitate and monitor mountaineering in the Everest region Taranath Adhikari the director general of Nepal s tourism department said they have plans to move the base camp to a lower altitude This would mean a longer distance for climbers between the base camp and Camp 1 However the present base camp is still useful and could still serve its purpose for three to four years The move may happen by 2024 per officials 81 In 2008 a new weather station at about 8 000 m 26 000 ft elevation went online 85 The project was orchestrated by Stations at High Altitude for Research on the Environment SHARE which also placed the Mount Everest webcam in 2011 85 86 The solar powered weather station is on the South Col 87 Mount Everest extends into the upper troposphere and penetrates the stratosphere 88 The air pressure at the summit is generally about one third what it is at sea level The altitude can expose the summit to the fast and freezing winds of the jet stream 89 Winds commonly attain 160 km h 100 mph 90 in February 2004 a wind speed of 280 km h 175 mph was recorded at the summit These winds can hamper or endanger climbers by blowing them into chasms 90 or by Bernoulli s principle by lowering the air pressure further reducing available oxygen by up to 14 percent 89 91 To avoid the harshest winds climbers typically aim for a 7 to 10 day window in the spring and fall when the Asian monsoon season is starting up or ending Mount Everest hosts several weather stations that collect important data on high altitude weather conditions Among them is the Balcony Station the highest weather station on the planet located at about 8 430 metres 27 660 ft above sea level Set up by climate scientists Tom Matthews and Baker Perry in 2019 this station is positioned just below the summit of Everest which is the highest point on Earth 92 As of January 20 2020 the Balcony Station ceased transmitting data 93 Because Everest is the highest mountain in the world it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts Whether the mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown It may have been climbed in 1924 although this has never been confirmed as neither man making the attempt returned Climbing routes have been established over decades of expeditions 94 The summit is first known to have been reached by humans in 1953 95 Despite the effort poured into expeditions only about 200 people had summited by 1987 95 Everest remained a difficult climb for decades even by professional climbers and large national expeditions which were the norm until the commercial era began in the 1990s 96 As of December 2024 update The Himalayan Database recorded just under 13 000 total summits by around 7 200 different people 97 98 99 Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs Everest is so high the jet stream can hit it Climbers can be faced with winds beyond 320 km h 200 mph when the weather shifts 100 At certain times of the year the jet stream shifts north providing periods of relative calm at the mountain 101 Other dangers include blizzards and avalanches 101 In 1885 Clinton Thomas Dent president of the Alpine Club suggested climbing Everest was possible in his book Above the Snow Line 102 The northern approach to the mountain was discovered by George Mallory and Guy Bullock on the initial 1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition It was not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the mountain With Mallory leading and thus becoming the first European to set foot on Everest s flanks they climbed the North Col to an altitude of 7 005 metres 22 982 ft From there Mallory espied a route to the top but the party was unprepared to climb further and descended The British returned for a 1922 expedition On the first summit attempt Mallory Col Felix Norton and Howard Somervell without supplemental oxygen reached 8 225 m 26 985 ft the first time a human reported to climb higher than 8 000 m 26 247 ft George Finch together with Geoffrey Bruce climbed using oxygen for the first time They ascended at a remarkable speed 290 metres 951 ft per hour and reached an altitude of 8 321 m 27 300 ft The next expedition was in 1924 The initial attempt by Mallory and Geoffrey Bruce was aborted when weather conditions prevented the establishment of Camp VI The next attempt was by Norton and Somervell who climbed without oxygen and in perfect weather traversing the North Face into the Great Couloir Norton managed to reach 8 572 8 m 28 126 ft though he ascended only 30 m 100 ft or so in the last hour Mallory used oxygen equipment for a last ditch effort He chose young Andrew Irvine as his partner 103 On 8 June 1924 George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made an attempt on the summit via the North Col North Ridge Northeast Ridge route from which they never returned On 1 May 1999 the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition found Mallory s body on the North Face in a snow basin below and to the west of the traditional site of Camp VI Controversy has raged in the mountaineering community whether one or both reached the summit 29 years before the first confirmed ascent and safe descent in 1953 Irvine s detached foot still in a boot and sock was found in 2024 104 In 1933 Lady Houston a British millionaire funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933 which saw a formation of two aeroplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale fly over the Everest summit 105 106 107 108 Early expeditions such as Charles Bruce s in the 1920s and Hugh Ruttledge s two unsuccessful attempts in 1933 and 1936 tried to ascend the mountain from Tibet via the North Face Access was closed from the north to Western expeditions in 1950 after China took control of Tibet In 1950 Bill Tilman and a small party which included Charles Houston Oscar Houston and Betsy Cowles undertook an exploratory expedition to Everest through Nepal along the route which has become the standard approach to Everest from the south 109 The 1952 Swiss Mount Everest expedition was granted permission to attempt a climb from Nepal It established a route through the Khumbu icefall and ascended to the South Col at an elevation of 7 986 m 26 201 ft Raymond Lambert and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay were able to reach an elevation of about 8 595 m 28 199 ft on the Southeast Ridge setting a new climbing altitude record Tenzing s experience was useful when he was hired to be part of the British expedition in 1953 110 The Swiss made another post monsoon attempt in the autumn they made it to the South Col but were driven back by winter winds and severe cold 111 112 In 1953 a ninth British expedition led by John Hunt returned to Nepal Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt the summit The first Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans came within 100 m 330 ft of the summit on 26 May 1953 but turned back after running into oxygen problems As planned their work in routefinding breaking trail and oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair Two days later the expedition made its second assault with the second pair New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay a Nepali Sherpa climber They reached the summit at 11 30 am local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route At the time both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first 113 They took photos and buried sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending 114 On 23 May 1956 Ernst Schmied and Juerg Marmet ascended 115 Wang Fuzhou Gonpo and Qu Yinhua of China made the first reported ascent of the peak from the North Ridge in May 1960 9 The first American to climb Everest Jim Whittaker joined by Nawang Gombu reached the summit on 1 May 1963 on the American Mount Everest expedition and on 22 May on the same expedition Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld were the first the traverse the mountain by climbing via the North Face and descending via the South Col 116 117 In 1970 Japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition The centrepiece was a large siege style expedition working on finding a new route up the Southwest Face 118 Another element was an attempt to ski Everest 96 Despite a staff of over one hundred and a decade of planning the expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit 96 However Japanese expeditions enjoyed some successes Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest from the South Col he descended nearly 1 300 vertical metres 4 200 ft from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries Another success was an expedition that put four on the summit via the South Col route 96 119 120 Miura s exploits became the subject of film and he went on to become the oldest person to summit Everest in 2003 aged 70 and in 2013 aged 80 121 In 1975 Junko Tabei became the first woman to summit Everest 96 The 1975 British Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition led and organised by Chris Bonington made the first ascent of the Southwest Face from the Western Cwm In 1978 Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler made the first ascent of Everest without supplemental oxygen The Polish climber Andrzej Zawada headed the first winter ascent of Everest the first winter ascent of an eight thousander On 15 January the team managed to set up Camp III at 7 150 metres 23 460 ft above sea level but further action was stopped by hurricane force winds The weather improved after 11 February when Leszek Cichy Walenty Fiut and Krzysztof Wielicki set up camp IV on South Col at 7 906 metres 25 938 ft Cichy and Wielicki started the final ascent at 6 50 am on 17 February At 2 40 pm Andrzej Zawada at base camp heard the climbers voices over the radio We are on the summit The strong wind blows all the time It is unimaginably cold 122 123 124 The successful winter ascent started a new decade of Winter Himalaism which became a Polish specialisation After 1980 Poles did ten first winter ascents on 8000 metre peaks 125 123 126 127 In 1989 Polish climbers under the leadership of Eugeniusz Chrobak organised an international expedition to Everest on a difficult western ridge Ten Poles and nine foreigners participated but only the Poles remained in the attempt for the summit On 24 May Chrobak and Andrzej Marciniak starting from camp V at 8 200 metres 26 900 ft overcame the ridge and reached the summit But on 27 May during an avalanche from the side of Khumbutse near the Lho La pass four climbers were killed Mirosław Dąsal Mirosław Gardzielewski Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich and Wacław Otręba The following day due to his injuries Chrobak died Marciniak who was injured was saved by a rescue expedition in which Artur Hajzer and New Zealanders Gary Ball and Rob Hall took part The organisation of the rescue included Reinhold Messner Elizabeth Hawley Carlos Carsolio and the US consul 128 On 10 and 11 May 1996 eight climbers died after guided expeditions were caught in a blizzard during a summit attempt on 10 May During the 1996 season 15 people died These were the highest death tolls for a single weather event and season until the 16 deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest ice avalanche The guiding disaster gained publicity and raised questions about the commercialisation of climbing and the safety of guiding clients on Everest Journalist Jon Krakauer on assignment from Outside magazine was in one of the affected guided parties and published the bestseller Into Thin Air which related his experience Krakauer was critical of guide Anatoli Boukreev 129 130 A year later Boukreev co authored The Climb in part as a rebuttal of Krakauer s portrayal 131 The dispute sparked debate within the climbing community Boukreev was awarded The American Alpine Club s David Sowles Award for his rescue efforts on the expedition 130 In 2004 researchers from the University of Toronto told the New Scientist that analysis of conditions on 11 May suggested that weather caused oxygen levels to plunge about 14 per cent 132 133 One survivor was Beck Weathers left for dead about 275 metres 900 feet from Camp 4 at 7 950 metres 26 085 feet After spending a night on the mountain Weathers made it back to Camp 4 with massive frostbite and vision impaired due to snow blindness 134 Fellow climbers considered his condition terminal and left him in a tent to die overnight 135 Weathers was lowered to Camp 2 and a helicopter rescue was organised by the Nepali Army 134 135 The storm s impact on climbers on the North Ridge where several climbers also died was detailed in a first hand account by Matt Dickinson in his book The Other Side of Everest Sixteen year old Mark Pfetzer was on the climb and wrote about it in Within Reach My Everest Story The 2015 feature film Everest is based on the events of this guiding disaster 136 In 2006 12 people died 140 David Sharp s death triggered debate and years of discussion about climbing ethics The question was whether climbers had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved He attempted to summit alone with two bottles of oxygen compared to the standard five used by most climbers 141 142 He arranged his permit through Asian Trekking a Kathmandu based company that provided basic services to base camp but not beyond that point 143 Sharp climbed without a radio or guide 142 Multiple climbing parties encountered Sharp in distress 144 Double amputee climber Mark Inglis said that on 15 May his climbing party and many others had passed Sharp sheltering under a rock overhang 450 metres 1 480 ft below the summit without attempting a rescue 145 Inglis said 40 people had passed by Sharp but he might have been overlooked as climbers assumed Sharp was the corpse nicknamed Green Boots 146 but Inglis was not aware that climbers had tried to help Sharp despite being in the process of helping an injured woman Burçak Özoğlu Poçan down There has been discussion about Himex in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp In regard to Inglis s initial comments he later revised details because he had been interviewed while he was physically and mentally exhausted and in much pain He had suffered frostbite he later had five fingertips amputated 147 It was estimated that Sharp summited on 14 May and began his descent but on 15 May he was in trouble and being passed by climbers on their way up and down 148 It is believed he was suffering from hypoxia and was about 300 m 1 000 ft from the summit on the North Side route 148 The Tribune India quoted someone who described what happened to Sharp as the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering 149 Much of this controversy was captured by the Discovery Channel while filming Everest Beyond the Limit A crucial decision affecting Sharp is shown where a returning climber adventurer Maxim Chaya is descending and radios his base camp manager Russell Brice that he has found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress Chaya is unable to identify Sharp who had chosen to climb solo and did not identify himself to other climbers The manager assumes Sharp is part of a group that has already calculated they must abandon him and informs his lone climber there is no chance of him being able to help Sharp by himself As Sharp s condition deteriorates and other descending climbers pass him his opportunities for rescue diminish his legs and feet curl from frostbite preventing him walking later descending climbers are lower on oxygen and lack the strength to offer aid time runs out for Sherpas to return and rescue him Sharp s body remained just below the summit on the Chinese side next to Green Boots they shared a space in a rock cave that was an ad hoc tomb 148 Sharp s body was removed from the cave in 2007 150 and since 2014 Green Boots has been missing presumably removed or buried 8 As the Sharp debate started on 26 May Australian climber Lincoln Hall was found alive after being left 151 He was found by a party of four climbers who giving up their own attempt stayed with Hall and descended with him and 11 Sherpas sent up to carry him down Hall fully recovered His team had assumed he had died from cerebral edema and were instructed to cover him with rocks 151 There were no rocks to do this and he was abandoned 152 The erroneous information of his death was passed to his family 152 On 21 May 2007 Canadian climber Meagan McGrath initiated the successful high altitude rescue of Nepali Usha Bista McGrath was selected as a 2011 recipient of the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation of Canada Humanitarian Award which recognises a Canadian who has contributed a significant service in the Himalayan Region of Nepal 153 By the end of 2010 there had been 5 104 summits by about 3 142 individuals with 77 per cent accomplished since 2000 154 The summit was achieved in 7 of the 22 years from 1953 to 1974 and not missed between 1975 and 2014 154 An illustration of the explosion of popularity is provided by the number of daily ascents Analysis of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster shows part of the blame was on the bottleneck caused by a large number of climbers 33 to 36 attempting to summit on the same day this was unusually high at the time By comparison on 23 May 2010 the summit was reached by 169 climbers more summits in a single day than in the 31 years from the first successful summit in 1953 to 1983 154 Nearly all attempts at the summit are done using one of two main routes In 2005 07 more than half elected to use the more challenging but cheaper northeast route In 2008 the northeast route was closed by the Chinese government for the season and the only people able to summit from the north that year were athletes carrying the Olympic torch for the 2008 Summer Olympics 155 The route was closed to foreigners in 2009 in the run up to the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama s exile 156 These closures led to declining interest in the north route and in 2010 two thirds summitted from the south 154 The 2010s were a time of new highs and lows for the mountain with disasters in 2013 and 2014 causing record deaths In 2015 there were no summits for the first time in decades 157 A record was set in 2019 with over 890 summiters 158 On 18 April 2014 an avalanche hit the area just below Base Camp 2 159 16 people were killed all Nepali guides and nine injured 160 In response Sherpa climbing guides walked off the job and most climbing companies pulled out in respect for the Sherpa people mourning their loss 161 162 2015 was set to be a record breaking season of climbs with hundreds of permits However on 25 April 2015 an earthquake measuring 7 8 Mw triggered an avalanche that hit Everest Base Camp 163 shutting down the season 164 18 bodies were recovered by the Indian Army mountaineering team 165 The avalanche began on Pumori 166 moved through the Khumbu Icefall on the southwest side of Everest and slammed into the South Base Camp 167 2015 was the first time since 1974 with no spring summits as all climbing teams pulled out 168 169 One reason for this was the high probability of aftershocks 170 Just weeks after the first quake the region experienced a 7 3 quake and there were many aftershocks 171 The quakes trapped hundreds of climbers above the Khumbu icefall and they had to be evacuated by helicopter as they ran low on supplies 172 The quake shifted the route through the ice fall making it impassable 172 Bad weather made helicopter evacuation difficult 172 There was a large impact overall on Nepal with 9 000 dead 173 174 In Tibet by 28 April at least 25 had died 175 Hawley s database records 641 made it to the summit in early 2016 184 2017 was the biggest season yet yielding hundreds of summiters and a handful of deaths 185 On 27 May Kami Rita made his 21st summit with the Alpine Ascents Everest Expedition one of three people along with Apa Sherpa and Phurba Tashi Sherpa to make it to the summit 21 times 186 187 The season had a tragic start with the death of Ueli Steck who died from a fall during a warm up climb 188 There was continued discussion about possible changes to the Hillary Step 189 Summiters for 2017 was tallied up to be 648 181 A record 891 summited in 2018 190 One factor that aided this was an especially long and clear weather window of 11 days during the critical spring climbing season 157 191 182 Various records were broken including a summit by double amputee Xia Boyu after winning a case in the Nepali Supreme Court 157 7 climbers died 157 Although record numbers summitted old time summiteers that made expeditions in the 1980s lamented the crowding feces and cost 191 The spring or pre monsoon window for 2019 witnessed the deaths of climbers Images of hundreds queuing to reach the summit and reports of climbers stepping over dead bodies dismayed people around the world 194 195 196 There was an announcement of an expedition to re measure the height of Everest particularly in light of the 2015 earthquakes 197 198 199 Among the climbing teams was a scientific expedition with a planned study of pollution and how things like snow and vegetation influence the availability of food and water in the region 200 In the 2019 spring season there were roughly 40 teams with almost 400 climbers and several hundred guides attempting to summit on the Nepali side 201 202 203 Nepal issued 381 climbing permits for 2019 190 For the northern routes in Chinese Tibet several hundred more permits were issued 204 In May Nepali mountaineering guide Kami Rita summited twice within a week his 23rd and 24th ascents 205 201 202 By 28 May the death toll reached 11 when a climber died at about 7 900 m 26 000 ft during the descent 192 and a 12th climber was missing and later declared dead 193 The deaths were possibly due to crowding leading to delays high on the mountain and shorter weather windows 190 Someone who had summited previously noted that when the weather window opens long lines form as everyone rushes to summit and get back down 206 207 Despite the number of deaths reports indicated that a record 891 climbers summited in the spring 2019 climbing season 208 158 Although China has had permit restrictions and Nepal requires a doctor to sign off on climbing permits 208 the natural dangers of climbing such as falls and avalanches combined with medical issues aggravated by Everest s extreme altitude led to 2019 being a year with a comparatively high death toll 208 Both Nepal and China prohibited foreign climbing groups during the 2020 season due to the COVID 19 pandemic 2020 saw no summits from the Nepal South Side 209 In October 2025 blizzard like conditions prompted Chinese authorities to evacuate nearly 350 people by October 6 with about 200 more stranded on the Everest Scenic Area 210 211 In 2014 Nepal issued 334 climbing permits which were extended until 2019 due to the closure 213 In 2015 Nepal issued 357 permits but the mountain was closed again because of the avalanche and earthquake and these permits were given a two year extension to 2017 214 213 In 2017 a person who tried to climb Everest without the 11 000 permit was caught after he made it past the Khumbu icefall He faced among other penalties a 22 000 fine and a possible four years in jail In the end he was allowed to return home but banned from mountaineering in Nepal for 10 years 215 The number of permits issued each year by Nepal is 214 216 The Chinese side in Tibet is also managed with permits for summiting Everest 219 They did not issue permits in 2008 due to the Olympic torch relay being taken to the summit of Mount Everest 220 In March 2020 the governments of China and Nepal cancelled all climbing permits for Mount Everest due to the COVID 19 pandemic 221 222 In April 2020 a group of Chinese mountaineers began an expedition from the Chinese side The mountain remained closed on the Chinese side to all foreign climbers 223 On 10 May 2021 a separation line was announced by Chinese authorities to prevent the spread of coronavirus from climbers ascending Nepal s side 224 According to Jon Krakauer the era of commercialisation of Everest started in 1985 when the summit was reached by a guided expedition led by David Breashears that included Richard Bass a wealthy 55 year old businessman and an amateur mountain climber with four years of climbing experience 226 By the early 1990s several companies were offering guided tours to the mountain Rob Hall one of the mountaineers who died in the 1996 disaster had successfully guided 39 clients to the summit before that incident 227 24 42 By 2016 most guiding services cost between US 35 000 and US 200 000 228 Going with a celebrity guide usually a well known mountaineer typically with decades of climbing experience and perhaps several Everest summits can cost over 100 000 as of 2015 229 However the services offered vary widely and it is buyer beware when doing deals in Nepal one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world 228 230 Tourism contributed 7 9 per cent of the gross domestic product GDP in 2019 231 in a country with high unemployment 232 but an Everest porter can make nearly double the nation s average wage in a region in which other sources of income are lacking 233 Costs beyond the guiding service can vary widely It is technically possible to reach the summit with minimal additional expenses and there are budget travel agencies that offer logistical support for such trips A limited support service offering only some meals at base camp and bureaucratic overhead like a permit can cost as little as US 7 000 as of 2007 147 However this is considered difficult and dangerous as illustrated by the case of David Sharp 234 Climbing gear required to reach the summit may cost in excess of US 8 000 and most climbers also use bottled oxygen which adds around US 3 000 235 The permit to enter the Everest area from the south via Nepal costs US 10 000 to US 30 000 per person depending on the size of the team 235 The ascent typically starts at one of the two base camps near the mountain both of which are approximately 100 kilometres 60 mi from Kathmandu and 300 kilometres 190 mi from Lhasa the two nearest cities with major airports Transferring one s equipment from the airport to the base camp may add as much as US 2 000 235 Many climbers hire full service guide companies which provide a wide spectrum of services including the acquisition of permits transportation to from base camp food tents fixed ropes 236 medical assistance while on the mountain an experienced mountaineer guide and even personal porters to carry one s backpack and cook one s meals The cost of such a guide service may range from US 40 000 to 80 000 per person 237 Since most equipment is moved by Sherpas clients of full service guide companies can often keep their backpack weights under 10 kilograms 22 lb or hire a Sherpa to carry their backpack for them By contrast climbers attempting less commercialised peaks like Denali are often expected to carry backpacks over 30 kilograms 66 lb and occasionally to tow a sled with 35 kilograms 77 lb of gear and food 238 The degree of commercialisation of Mount Everest is a frequent subject of criticism 176 Jamling Tenzing Norgay the son of Tenzing Norgay said in a 2003 interview that his late father would have been shocked to discover that rich thrill seekers with no climbing experience were now routinely reaching the summit You still have to climb this mountain yourself with your feet But the spirit of adventure is not there any more It is lost There are people going up there who have no idea how to put on crampons They are climbing because they have paid someone 65 000 It is very selfish It endangers the lives of others 239 One example of this is Shriya Shah Klorfine who had to be taught how to put on crampons during her summit attempt in 2012 240 She paid at least US 40 000 to a new guiding company for the trip and died when she ran out of oxygen during the descent after climbing for 27 hours straight 241 Reinhold Messner concurred in 2004 You could die in each climb and that meant you were responsible for yourself We were real mountaineers careful aware and even afraid By climbing mountains we were not learning how big we were We were finding out how breakable how weak and how full of fear we are You can only get this if you expose yourself to high danger I have always said that a mountain without danger is not a mountain High altitude alpinism has become tourism and show These commercial trips to Everest they are still dangerous But the guides and organisers tell clients Don t worry it s all organised The route is prepared by hundreds of Sherpas Extra oxygen is available in all camps right up to the summit People will cook for you and lay out your beds Clients feel safe and don t care about the risks 242 By 2015 Nepal was considering requiring that climbers have some experience hoping this would both make the mountain safer and increase revenue 243 One barrier to this is that low budget firms make money not taking inexperienced climbers to the summit 228 Those turned away by Western firms can often find another firm willing to take them for a price that they return home soon after arriving after base camp or part way up the mountain 228 However not all opinions on the subject among prominent mountaineers have been strictly negative For example Edmund Hillary stated in 2003 that while Having people pay 65 000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guides isn t really mountaineering at all 244 he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area by Westerners I don t have any regrets because I worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people When we first went in there they didn t have any schools they didn t have any medical facilities all over the years we have established 27 schools we have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then we ve built bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines so in cooperation with the Sherpas we ve done a lot to benefit them 245 One of the early guided summiters Richard Bass of Seven Summits fame stated in 2003 that Climbers should have high altitude experience before they attempt the really big mountains People don t realise the difference between a 20 000 foot 6 100 m mountain and 29 000 foot 8 800 m It s not just arithmetic The reduction of oxygen in the air is proportionate to the altitude alright but the effect on the human body is disproportionate an exponential curve People climb Denali 6 190 m or 20 320 ft or Aconcagua 6 960 m or 22 834 ft and think Heck I feel great up here I m going to try Everest But it s not like that 246 Some expedition teams have clients use altitude tents to pre acclimatise prior to leaving for the mountain Compared to traditional Everest expeditions that last 50 to 60 days altitude tents can reduce the expedition time frame to 30 to 35 days 247 In 2025 four men climbed the mountain in one week They claimed their inhalation of xenon gas 10 days prior to stimulate erythropoietin production had eliminated the need for altitude acclimatisation over several weeks The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation UIAA criticised the decision citing that there is no evidence that the inhalation of xenon improves performance in high elevation environments Furthermore the UIAA warned that as an anesthetic xenon gas could result in impaired brain function respiratory compromise and death if used in an unmonitored setting 248 249 250 Summiting Everest with disabilities has become popular in the 21st century Sudarshan Gautam a Canadian double amputee summited the mountain in 2013 251 In the same year Eli Reimer a teenager with Down syndrome hiked to the South Base Camp as part of a fundraising effort for his father s foundation 252 Mount Everest has two main climbing routes the Southeast Ridge from Nepal and the North Ridge from Tibet as well as many other less frequently climbed routes 253 Of the two main routes the Southeast Ridge is technically easier and more frequently used It was the route used by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996 253 This was however a route decision dictated more by politics than by design as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s after Annexation of Tibet by the People s Republic of China 254 Most attempts are made during May before the summer monsoon season As the monsoon season approaches the jet stream shifts northward thereby reducing the average wind speeds high on the mountain 255 256 While attempts are sometimes made in September and October after the monsoons when the jet stream is again temporarily pushed northward the additional snow deposited by the monsoons and the less stable weather patterns at the monsoons tail end makes climbing extremely difficult The ascent via the Southeast Ridge begins with a trek to Base Camp at 5 380 m 17 700 ft on the south side of Everest in Nepal Expeditions usually fly into Lukla 2 860 m from Kathmandu and pass through Namche Bazaar Climbers then hike to Base Camp which usually takes six to eight days allowing for proper altitude acclimatisation in order to prevent altitude sickness 257 Climbing equipment and supplies are carried by yaks dzopkyos yak cow hybrids and human porters to Base Camp on the Khumbu Glacier When Hillary and Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953 the British expedition they were part of comprising over 400 climbers porters and Sherpas at that point started from the Kathmandu Valley as there were no roads further east at that time Climbers spend a couple of weeks in Base Camp acclimatising to the altitude During that time Sherpas and some expedition climbers set up ropes and ladders in the treacherous Khumbu Icefall Seracs crevasses and shifting blocks of ice make the icefall one of the most dangerous sections of the route Many climbers and Sherpas have been killed in this section To reduce the hazard climbers usually begin their ascent well before dawn when the freezing temperatures glue ice blocks in place Above the icefall is Camp I at 6 065 metres 19 900 ft From Camp I climbers make their way up the Western Cwm to the base of the Lhotse Face where Camp II or Advanced Base Camp ABC is established at 6 500 m 21 300 ft The Western Cwm is a flat gently rising glacial valley marked by huge lateral crevasses in the centre which prevent direct access to the upper reaches of the Cwm Climbers are forced to cross on the far right near the base of Nuptse to a small passageway known as the Nuptse corner The Western Cwm is also called the Valley of Silence as the topography of the area generally cuts off wind from the climbing route The high altitude and a clear windless day can make the Western Cwm unbearably hot for climbers 258 From Camp II climbers ascend the Lhotse Face on fixed ropes up to Camp III located on a small ledge at 7 470 m 24 500 ft From there it is another 500 metres to Camp IV on the South Col at 7 920 m 26 000 ft From Camp III to Camp IV climbers are faced with two additional challenges the Geneva Spur and the Yellow Band The Geneva Spur is an anvil shaped rib of black rock named by the 1952 Swiss expedition Fixed ropes assist climbers in scrambling over this snow covered rock band The Yellow Band is a section of interlayered marble phyllite and semischist which also requires about 100 metres of rope for traversing it 258 On the South Col climbers enter the death zone Climbers making summit bids typically can endure no more than two or three days at this altitude If the weather is not clear with low winds during these short few days climbers are forced to descend many all the way back down to Base Camp From Camp IV climbers begin their summit push around midnight with hopes of reaching the summit still another 1 000 metres above within 10 to 12 hours Climbers first reach The Balcony at 8 400 m 27 600 ft a small platform where they can rest and gaze at peaks to the south and east in the early light of dawn Continuing up the ridge climbers are then faced with a series of imposing rock steps which usually forces them to the east into the waist deep snow a serious avalanche hazard At 8 750 m 28 700 ft a small table sized dome of ice and snow marks the South Summit 258 From the South Summit climbers follow the knife edge Southeast Ridge along what is known as the Cornice traverse where snow clings to intermittent rock This is the most exposed section of the climb and a misstep to the left would send one 2 400 m 7 900 ft down the Southwest Face while to the immediate right is the 3 050 m 10 010 ft Kangshung Face At the end of this traverse is an imposing 12 m 39 ft rock wall the Hillary Step at 8 790 m 28 840 ft 259 Hillary and Tenzing were the first climbers to ascend this step and did so using primitive ice climbing equipment and ropes Nowadays climbers ascend using fixed ropes previously set up by Sherpas Once above the step it is a comparatively easy climb to the top on moderately angled snow slopes though the exposure on the ridge is extreme especially while traversing large cornices of snow With increasing numbers climbing the mountain the Step has frequently become a bottleneck with climbers forced to wait significant amounts of time for their turn on the ropes leading to problems in getting climbers efficiently up and down the mountain citation needed After the Hillary Step climbers must traverse a loose and rocky section that has a large entanglement of fixed ropes that can be troublesome in bad weather Climbers typically spend less than half an hour at the summit to allow time to descend to Camp IV before darkness sets in to avoid serious problems with afternoon weather or because supplemental oxygen tanks run out The North Ridge route begins from the north side of Everest in Tibet Expeditions trek to the Rongbuk Glacier setting up base camp at 5 180 m 16 990 ft on a gravel plain just below the glacier To reach Camp II climbers ascend the medial moraine of the east Rongbuk Glacier up to the base of Changtse at around 6 100 m 20 000 ft Camp III ABC Advanced Base Camp is situated below the North Col at 6 500 m 21 300 ft To reach Camp IV on the North Col climbers ascend the glacier to the foot of the col where fixed ropes are used to reach the North Col at 7 010 m 23 000 ft From the North Col climbers ascend the rocky North Ridge to set up Camp V at around 7 775 m 25 500 ft The route crosses the North Face in a diagonal climb to the base of the Yellow Band reaching the site of Camp VI at 8 230 m 27 000 ft From Camp VI climbers make their final summit push Climbers face a treacherous traverse from the base of the First Step ascending from 8 501 to 8 534 m 27 890 to 28 000 ft to the crux of the climb the Second Step ascending from 8 577 to 8 626 m 28 140 to 28 300 ft The Second Step includes a climbing aid called the Chinese ladder a metal ladder placed semi permanently in 1975 by a party of Chinese climbers 260 It has been almost continuously in place since and ladders have been used by virtually all climbers on the route Once above the Second Step the inconsequential Third Step is clambered over ascending from 8 690 to 8 800 m 28 510 to 28 870 ft Once above these steps the summit pyramid is climbed by a snow slope of 50 degrees to the final summit ridge along which the top is reached 261 The summit of Everest has been described as the size of a dining room table 262 The summit is capped with snow over ice over rock and the layer of snow varies from year to year 263 The rock summit is made of Ordovician limestone and is a low grade metamorphic rock 264 See the Surveys section for more on its height and about the Everest rock summit Below the summit there is an area known as rainbow valley filled with dead bodies still wearing brightly coloured winter gear Down to about 8 000 m 26 000 ft is an area commonly called the death zone due to the high danger and low oxygen because of the low pressure 88 At the higher regions of Mount Everest climbers seeking the summit typically spend substantial time within the death zone altitudes higher than 8 000 m or 26 000 ft and face significant challenges to survival Temperatures can dip to very low levels resulting in frostbite of any body part exposed to the air Since temperatures are so low snow is well frozen in certain areas and death or injury by slipping and falling can occur High winds at these altitudes on Everest are also a potential threat to climbers Another significant threat to climbers is low atmospheric pressure The atmospheric pressure at the top of Everest is about a third of sea level pressure or 0 333 standard atmospheres 337 mbar resulting in the availability of only about a third as much oxygen to breathe 265 A sea level dweller exposed to the atmospheric conditions at the altitude above 8 500 m 27 900 ft without acclimatisation would likely lose consciousness within two to three minutes 266 At sea level blood oxygen saturation is generally 98 to 99 per cent At base camp blood saturation fell to between 85 and 87 per cent Blood samples taken at the summit indicated very low oxygen levels in the blood A side effect of low blood oxygen is a greatly increased breathing rate often 80 90 breaths per minute as opposed to a more typical 20 30 Exhaustion can occur merely by attempting to breathe 267 Lack of oxygen exhaustion extreme cold and climbing hazards all contribute to the death toll An injured person who cannot walk is in serious trouble since rescue by helicopter is generally impractical and carrying the person off the mountain is very risky People who die during the climb are typically left behind As of 2015 over 200 bodies remain on the mountain 8 Debilitating symptoms consistent with high altitude cerebral oedema commonly present during descent from the summit of Mount Everest Profound fatigue and late times in reaching the summit are early features associated with subsequent death Mortality on Mount Everest 1921 2006 descriptive study 268 A 2008 study noted that the death zone is indeed where most Everest deaths occur but also noted that most deaths occur during descent from the summit 269 A 2014 article in The Atlantic about deaths on Everest noted that while falling is one of the greatest dangers the death zone presents for all 8000ers avalanches are a more common cause of death at lower altitudes 270 Despite this Everest is safer for climbers than a number of peaks by some measurements but it depends on the period 271 Some examples are Kangchenjunga K2 Annapurna Nanga Parbat and the Eiger especially the nordwand 271 Some factors that affect total mountain lethality include the level of popularity of the mountain the skill of those climbing and the difficulty of the climb 272 Another health hazard is retinal haemorrhages which can damage eyesight and cause blindness 273 Up to a quarter of Everest climbers can experience retinal haemorrhages and although they usually heal within weeks of returning to lower altitudes in 2010 a climber went blind and died in the death zone 273 The team made a huge effort for the next 12 hours to try to get him down the mountain but to no avail as they were unsuccessful in getting him through the difficult sections 274 Even for the able Everest s Northeast Ridge is recognised as a challenge It is hard to rescue someone who has become incapacitated and it can be beyond the ability of rescuers to save anyone in such a difficult spot 274 One way around this situation was pioneered by two Nepali men in 2011 who had intended to paraglide off the summit They had no choice and were forced to go through with their plan anyway because they had run out of bottled oxygen and supplies 275 They successfully launched off the summit and para glided down to Namche Bazaar in just 42 minutes without having to climb down the mountain 275 Most expeditions use oxygen masks and tanks above 8 000 m 26 247 ft 276 Everest can be climbed without supplementary oxygen but only by the most accomplished mountaineers and at increased risk Low oxygen impairs cognition and the combination of extreme weather low temperatures and steep slopes often requires quick accurate decisions While about 95 per cent of climbers who reach the summit use bottled oxygen in order to reach the top about five per cent of climbers have summited Everest without supplemental oxygen The death rate is double for those who attempt to reach the summit without supplemental oxygen 277 Travelling above 8 000 m 26 000 ft altitude is a factor in cerebral hypoxia 278 One study found that Mount Everest may be the highest an acclimatised human could go but also found that climbers may suffer permanent neurological damage despite returning to lower altitudes 278 The use of bottled oxygen to ascend Mount Everest has been controversial It was first used on the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition by George Finch and Geoffrey Bruce who climbed up to 7 800 m 25 600 ft at a spectacular speed of 300 vertical metres per hour 1 000 ft h Pinned down by a fierce storm they escaped death by breathing oxygen from a jury rigged set up during the night The next day they climbed to 8 100 m 26 600 ft at 270 m h 900 ft h nearly three times as fast as non oxygen users Yet the use of oxygen was considered so unsportsmanlike that none of the rest of the Alpine world recognised this high ascent rate citation needed George Mallory described the use of such oxygen as unsportsmanlike but he later concluded that it would be impossible for him to summit without it and consequently used it on his final attempt in 1924 279 When Tenzing and Hillary made the first successful summit in 1953 they also used open circuit bottled oxygen sets with the expedition s physiologist Griffith Pugh referring to the oxygen debate as a futile controversy noting that oxygen greatly increases subjective appreciation of the surroundings which after all is one of the chief reasons for climbing 280 For the next twenty five years bottled oxygen was considered standard for any successful summit although an acclimatised lowlander can survive for a time on the summit of Everest without supplemental oxygen one is so close to the limit that even a modicum of excess exertion may impair brain function Thomas F Hornbein in The high altitude brain 278 Reinhold Messner was the first climber to break the bottled oxygen tradition and in 1978 with Peter Habeler made the first successful climb without it In 1980 Messner summited the mountain solo without supplemental oxygen or any porters or climbing partners on the more difficult northwest route Once the climbing community was satisfied that the mountain could be climbed without supplemental oxygen many purists then took the next logical step of insisting that is how it should be climbed 227 154 The aftermath of the 1996 disaster further intensified the debate Jon Krakauer s Into Thin Air 1997 expressed the author s personal criticisms of the use of bottled oxygen Krakauer wrote that the use of bottled oxygen allowed otherwise unqualified climbers to attempt to summit leading to dangerous situations and more deaths The disaster was partially caused by the sheer number of climbers 34 on that day attempting to ascend causing bottlenecks at the Hillary Step and delaying many climbers most of whom summited after the usual 14 00 turnaround time He proposed banning bottled oxygen except for emergency cases arguing that this would both decrease the growing pollution on Everest many bottles have accumulated on its slopes and keep marginally qualified climbers off the mountain The 1996 disaster also introduced the issue of the guide s role in using bottled oxygen 281 Guide Anatoli Boukreev s decision not to use bottled oxygen was sharply criticised by Jon Krakauer Boukreev s supporters who include G Weston DeWalt who co wrote The Climb state that using bottled oxygen gives a false sense of security 282 Krakauer and his supporters point out that without bottled oxygen Boukreev could not directly help his clients descend 283 The low oxygen can cause a mental fog like impairment of cognitive abilities described as delayed and lethargic thought process clinically defined as bradypsychia even after returning to lower altitudes 284 In severe cases climbers can experience hallucinations Some studies have found that high altitude climbers including Everest climbers experience altered brain structure 284 Although generally less popular than spring Mount Everest has also been climbed in the autumn also called the post monsoon season 69 285 For example in 2010 Eric Larsen and five Nepali guides summited Everest in the autumn for the first time in ten years 285 The autumn season when the monsoon ends is regarded as more dangerous because there is typically a lot of new snow which can be unstable 101 However this increased snow can make it more popular with certain winter sports like skiing and snowboarding 69 Two Japanese climbers also summited in October 1973 286 Chris Chandler and Bob Cormack summited Everest in October 1976 as part of the American Bicentennial Everest Expedition that year the first Americans to make an autumn ascent of Mount Everest according to the Los Angeles Times 287 By the 21st century summer and autumn can be more popular with skiing and snowboard attempts on Mount Everest 288 During the 1980s climbing in autumn was actually more popular than in spring 289 U S astronaut Karl Gordon Henize died in October 1993 on an autumn expedition conducting an experiment on radiation The amount of background radiation increases with higher altitudes 290 The mountain has also been climbed in the winter but that is not popular because of the combination of cold high winds and shorter days 291 By January the peak is typically battered by 270 km h 170 mph winds and the average temperature of the summit is around 33 F 36 C 69 Some climbers have reported life threatening thefts from supply caches In May 2006 Vitor Negrete the first Brazilian to climb Everest without oxygen and part of David Sharp s party died during his descent and theft of gear and food from his high altitude camp may have contributed 292 293 In addition to theft Michael Kodas describes in his book High Crimes The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed 2008 294 unethical guides and Sherpas prostitution and gambling at the Tibet Base Camp fraud related to the sale of oxygen bottles and climbers collecting donations under the pretense of removing trash from the mountain 295 296 The Chinese side of Everest in Tibet was described as out of control in 2007 after one Canadian had all his gear stolen and was abandoned by his Sherpa 297 Another Sherpa helped the victim get off the mountain safely and gave him some spare gear Other climbers have also reported missing oxygen bottles which can be worth hundreds of dollars each Hundreds of climbers pass by people s tents making it hard to safeguard against theft 297 In the late 2010s the reports of theft of oxygen bottles from camps became more common 298 By the end of the 2010 climbing season there had been 5 104 ascents to the summit by about 3 142 individuals 154 Some notable firsts by climbers include Lucy Lady Houston a British millionaire former showgirl funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933 A formation of airplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale flew over the summit in an effort to photograph the unknown terrain 312 On 26 September 1988 having climbed the mountain via the Southeast Ridge Jean Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest 307 in the process creating the record for the fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider flight Boivin said I was tired when I reached the top because I had broken much of the trail and to run at this altitude was quite hard 313 In 1991 four men in two balloons achieved the first hot air balloon flight over Mount Everest 314 In one balloon were Andy Elson and Eric Jones cameraman and in the other balloon Chris Dewhirst and Leo Dickinson cameraman 315 Dickinson went on to write a book about the adventure called Ballooning Over Everest 315 The hot air balloons were modified to function at up to 12 000 m 40 000 ft altitude 315 Reinhold Messner called one of Dickinson s panoramic views of Everest captured on the now discontinued Kodak Kodachrome film the best snap on Earth according to UK newspaper The Telegraph 316 Dewhirst has offered to take passengers on a repeat of this feat for US 2 6 million per passenger 314 In May 2005 pilot Didier Delsalle of France landed a Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter on the summit of Mount Everest 317 He needed to land for two minutes to set the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale FAI official record but he stayed for about four minutes twice 317 In this type of landing the rotors stay engaged which avoids relying on the snow to fully support the aircraft The flight set rotorcraft world records for highest of both landing and take off 318 Some press reports suggested that the report of the summit landing was a misunderstanding of a South Col landing but he had also landed on South Col two days earlier 319 with this landing and the Everest records confirmed by the FAI 318 Delsalle also rescued two Japanese climbers at 4 880 m 16 000 ft while he was there One climber noted that the new record meant a better chance of rescue 317 On 21 May 2011 Nepalis Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa and Sano Babu Sunuwar paraglided from Everest s summit to Namche Bazaar in 42 minutes 275 320 After the flight they hiked biked and kayaked to the Indian Ocean reaching the Bay of Bengal by 27 June 2011 thereby becoming the first people to complete a continuous summit to sea descent from Everest 321 They accomplished the ground breaking feat despite Babu having never previously climbed and Lakpa having never kayaked and not even knowing how to swim 321 The duo subsequently won National Geographic Adventurers of the Year for 2012 for their exploits 321 In 2013 footage of the flight was shown on the television news program Nightline 322 In 2014 a team financed and led by mountaineer Wang Jing used a helicopter to fly from South Base Camp to Camp II to avoid the Khumbu Icefall and thence climbed to the Everest summit 323 This climb immediately sparked outrage and controversy in much of the mountaineering world over the legitimacy and propriety of her climb 324 325 Nepal ended up investigating Wang who initially denied the claim that she had flown to Camp II admitting only that some support crew were flown to that higher camp over the Khumbu Icefall 326 In August 2014 however she stated that she had flown to Camp II because the icefall was impassable If you don t fly to Camp II you just go home she said in an interview In that same interview she also insisted that she had never tried to hide this fact 324 Her team had had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb Ultimately the Chinese refusal may have been beneficial to Nepal s interests allowing the government to showcase improved local hospitals and providing the opportunity for a new hybrid aviation mountaineering style triggering discussions about helicopter use in the mountaineering world 324 National Geographic noted that a village festooned Wang with honours after she donated US 30 000 to the town s hospital Wang won the International Mountaineer of the Year Award from the Nepal government in June 2014 323 In 2016 the increased use of helicopters was noted for increased efficiency and for hauling material over the deadly Khumbu icefall 327 In particular it was noted that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased commercial activity at Everest 327 After many Nepalis died in the icefall in 2014 the government had wanted helicopters to handle more transportation to Camp 1 but this was not possible because of the 2015 earthquake closing the mountain so this was then implemented in 2016 helicopters did prove instrumental in rescuing many people in 2015 though 327 That summer Bell tested the 412EPI which conducted a series of tests including hovering at 5 500 m 18 000 ft and flying as high as 6 100 m 20 000 ft altitude near Mount Everest 328 Mount Everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring besides mountaineering including snowboarding skiing paragliding and BASE jumping Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest in the 1970s He descended nearly 1 300 vertical metres 4 200 ft from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries 96 Stefan Gatt and Marco Siffredi snowboarded Mount Everest in 2001 329 Other Everest skiers include Davo Karničar of Slovenia who completed a top to South Base Camp descent in 2000 Hans Kammerlander of Italy in 1996 on the north side and Kit DesLauriers of the United States in 2006 330 Marco Siffredi died in 2002 on his second snow boarding expedition 329 Various types of gliding descents have slowly become more popular and are noted for their rapid descents to lower camps In 1986 Steve McKinney led an expedition to Mount Everest 331 Frenchman Jean Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest in September 1988 descending in minutes from the Southeast Ridge to a lower camp 307 In 2011 two Nepalis made a gliding descent from the Everest summit down 5 000 metres 16 400 ft in 45 minutes 332 The southern part of Mount Everest is regarded as one of several hidden valleys of refuge designated by Padmasambhava a ninth century lotus born Buddhist saint 333 Near the base of the north side of Everest lies Rongbuk Monastery which has been called the sacred threshold to Mount Everest with the most dramatic views of the world 334 For Sherpas living on the slopes of Everest in the Khumbu region of Nepal Rongbuk Monastery is an important pilgrimage site accessed in a few days of travel across the Himalayas through Nangpa La 113 Miyolangsangma a Tibetan Buddhist Goddess of Inexhaustible Giving is believed to have lived at the top of Mount Everest According to Sherpa Buddhist monks Mount Everest is Miyolangsangma s palace and playground and all climbers are only partially welcome guests having arrived without invitation 333 The Sherpa people also believe that Mount Everest and its flanks are blessed with spiritual energy and one should show reverence when passing through this sacred landscape Here the karmic effects of one s actions are magnified and impure thoughts are best avoided 333 In 2015 the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution especially human waste has reached critical levels As much as 12 000 kg 26 500 lb of human excrement each season is left behind on the mountain 335 Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest s south side minefields of human excrement Climbers above Base Camp for the 62 year history of climbing on the mountain have most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow or slung it into crevasses or simply defecated wherever convenient often within metres of their tents The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp At approximately 5 500 m 18 000 ft Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there In the late 1990s expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic 190 litre 50 US gallon barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed 336 The problem of human waste is compounded by the presence of more anodyne waste spent oxygen tanks abandoned tents empty cans and bottles The Nepali government now requires each climber to pack out eight kilograms of waste when descending the mountain 337 In February 2019 due to the mounting waste problem China closed the base camp on its side of Everest to visitors without climbing permits Tourists are allowed to go as far as the Rongbuk Monastery 338 In April 2019 the Solukhumbu district s Khumbu Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality launched a campaign to collect nearly 10 000 kg 20 000 lb of garbage from Everest 339 Five years later 2024 waste removal is receiving continuing attention 340 341 342
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut,A doughnut also spelled donut a b is a type of pastry made from leavened fried dough 3 4 275 It is popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries supermarkets food stalls and franchised specialty vendors Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough but other types of batters can also be used Various toppings and flavors are used for different types such as sugar chocolate or maple glazing Doughnuts may also include water leavening eggs milk sugar oil shortening and natural or artificial flavors The two most common types are the ring doughnut and the filled doughnut which is injected with fruit preserves the jelly doughnut cream custard or other sweet fillings Small pieces of dough are sometimes cooked as doughnut holes Once fried doughnuts may be glazed with a sugar icing spread with icing or chocolate or topped with powdered sugar cinnamon sprinkles or fruit Other shapes include balls flattened spheres twists and other forms Doughnut varieties are also divided into cake including the old fashioned and yeast risen doughnuts Doughnuts are often accompanied by coffee or milk A recipe for a deep fried dough ball was recorded by Cato the Elder in his De agri cultura using cheese honey and poppy seeds called globi 5 Similar types of fried dough recipes have either spread to or originated in other parts of Europe and the World 6 A 13th century Arabic cookbook written by Ibn Razīn al Tujībī contains a recipe for a doughnut like variant of sfenj made by frying leavened semolina dough the dough is meant to be shaped into a small ball the recipe also calls for shaping the dough into a Ka ak with a hole in the middle to test its proofing 7 This is done before frying the first batch and results in a shape reminiscent of a modern doughnut 8 The cookbook Küchenmeisterei Mastery of the Kitchen published in Nuremberg in 1485 offers a recipe for Gefüllte Krapfen stuffed fried dough cakes 9 The Spanish and Portuguese churro is a choux pastry dough that would also be served in a ring shape The recipe may have been brought from or introduced to China in the 16th century 10 11 Dutch settlers brought olykoek oil cake to New York or New Amsterdam in the early 18th century These doughnuts closely resembled later ones but did not yet have their current ring shape 12 13 14 A recipe for fried dough nuts was published in 1750 England under the title How to make Hertfordshire Cakes Nuts and Pincushions in The Country Housewife s Family Companion by William Ellis 15 16 A recipe labelled dow nuts again from Hertfordshire was found in a book of recipes and domestic tips written around 1800 by the wife of Baron Thomas Dimsdale 17 the recipe being given to the dowager Baroness by an acquaintance who transcribed for her the cooking instructions for a dow nut 18 The first cookbook using the near conventional dough nuts spelling was possibly the 1803 edition of The Frugal Housewife Or Complete Woman Cook which included dough nuts in an appendix of American recipes 19 One of the earliest mentions of dough nut was in Washington Irving s 1809 book A History of New York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty 20 Sometimes the table was graced with immense apple pies or saucers full of preserved peaches and pears but it was always sure to boast of an enormous dish of balls of sweetened dough fried in hog s fat and called dough nuts or oly koeks a delicious kind of cake at present scarce known in this city excepting in genuine Dutch families The name oly koeks was almost certainly related to the oliekoek a Dutch delicacy of sweetened cake fried in fat 21 One of the earliest known literary usages of the term dates to an 1808 short story 22 describing a spread of fire cakes and dough nuts Washington Irving described dough nuts in his 1809 History of New York as balls of sweetened dough fried in hog s fat and called dough nuts or olykoeks 23 These nuts of fried dough might now be called doughnut holes The word nut is here used in the earlier sense of small rounded cake or cookie also seen in ginger nut 24 Doughnut is the traditional spelling and still dominates even in the United States 25 26 27 though donut is often used 28 29 At present doughnut and the shortened form donut are both pervasive in American English 30 The first known printed use of donut was in Peck s Bad Boy and his Pa by George W Peck published in 1900 in which a character is quoted as saying Pa said he guessed he hadn t got much appetite and he would just drink a cup of coffee and eat a donut 31 According to author John T Edge the alternative spelling donut was invented in the 1920s when the New York based Display Doughnut Machine Corporation abbreviated the word to make it more pronounceable by the foreigners they hoped would buy their automated doughnut making equipment 32 The donut spelling also showed up in a Los Angeles Times article dated August 10 1929 in which Bailey Millard jokingly complains about the decline of spelling and that he can t swallow the wel dun donut nor the ever so gud bred The interchangeability of the two spellings can be found in a series of National Donut Week articles in The New York Times that covered the 1939 World s Fair In four articles beginning 9 October two mention the donut spelling Dunkin Donuts which was so named in 1950 following its 1948 founding under the name Open Kettle Quincy Massachusetts is the oldest surviving company to use the donut variation other chains such as the defunct Mayflower Doughnut Corporation 1931 did not use that spelling 33 According to the Oxford Dictionaries while doughnut is used internationally the spelling donut is American 34 with Krispy Kreme being a notable exception 35 The spelling donut remained rare until the 1950s and has since grown significantly in popularity 36 Hanson Gregory an American claimed to have invented the ring shaped doughnut in 1847 aboard a lime trading ship when he was 16 years old Gregory was dissatisfied with the greasiness of doughnuts twisted into various shapes and with the raw center of regular doughnuts He claimed to have punched a hole in the center of dough with the ship s tin pepper box and to have later taught the technique to his mother 37 Smithsonian Magazine states that his mother Elizabeth Gregory made a wicked deep fried dough that cleverly used her son s spice cargo of nutmeg and cinnamon along with lemon rind and put hazelnuts or walnuts in the center where the dough might not cook through and called the food doughnuts 12 Ring doughnuts are formed by one of two methods by joining the ends of a long skinny piece of dough into a ring or by using a doughnut cutter which simultaneously cuts the outside and inside shape leaving a doughnut shaped piece of dough and a doughnut hole the dough removed from the center This smaller piece of dough can be cooked and served as a doughnut hole or added back to the batch to make more doughnuts A disk shaped doughnut can also be stretched and pinched into a torus until the center breaks to form a hole Alternatively a doughnut depositor can be used to place a circle of liquid dough batter directly into the fryer There are two types of ring doughnuts those made from a yeast based dough for raised doughnuts or those made from a special type of cake batter 16 38 39 Yeast raised doughnuts contain about 25 oil by weight whereas cake doughnuts oil content is around 20 but have extra fat included in the batter before frying Cake doughnuts are fried for about 90 seconds at approximately 190 to 198 C 374 to 388 F turning once Yeast raised doughnuts absorb more oil because they take longer to fry about 150 seconds at 182 to 190 C 360 to 374 F Cake doughnuts typically weigh between 24 and 28 g 0 85 and 0 99 oz whereas yeast raised doughnuts average 38 g 1 3 oz and are generally larger and taller due to rising when finished citation needed Daniela Galarza for Eater wrote that the now standard doughnut s hole is still up for debate Food writer Michael Krondl surmises that the shape came from recipes that called for the dough to be shaped like a jumble a once common ring shaped cookie In Cuisine and Culture A History of Food and People culinary historian Linda Civitello writes that the hole was invented because it allowed the doughnuts to cook faster By 1870 doughnut cutters shaped in two concentric circles one smaller than the other began to appear in home shopping catalogues 16 After frying ring doughnuts are often topped Raised doughnuts are generally covered with a glaze icing Cake doughnuts can also be glazed powdered with confectioner s sugar or covered with cinnamon and granulated sugar They are also often topped with cake frosting top only and sometimes sprinkled with coconut chopped peanuts or sprinkles Doughnut holes are small bite sized doughnuts that were traditionally made from the dough taken from the center of ring doughnuts Before long doughnut sellers saw the opportunity to market holes as a novelty and many chains offer their own variety some with their own brand names such as Munchkins from Dunkin Donuts 40 41 and Timbits from Tim Hortons 42 Traditionally doughnut holes are made by frying the dough removed from the center portion of the doughnut 43 Consequently they are considerably smaller than a standard doughnut and tend to be spherical Similar to standard doughnuts doughnut holes may be topped with confections such as glaze or powdered sugar Originally most varieties of doughnut holes were derivatives of their ring doughnut yeast based dough or cake batter counterparts However doughnut holes can also be made by dropping a small ball of dough into hot oil from a specially shaped nozzle or cutter 44 This production method has allowed doughnut sellers to produce bite sized versions of non ring doughnuts such as filled doughnuts fritters and Dutchies Filled doughnuts are flattened spheres injected with fruit preserves cream custard or other sweet fillings and often dipped into powdered sugar or topped off with frosting Common varieties include the Boston cream coconut key lime and jelly Others include the fritter and the Dutchie which are usually glazed These have been available on Tim Hortons doughnut menu since the chain s inception in 1964 45 and a 1991 Toronto Star report found these two were the chain s most popular type of fried dough in Canada 46 There are many other specialized doughnut shapes such as old fashioned bars or Long Johns a rectangular shape or twists Other shapes include balls flattened spheres twists and other forms 47 48 16 In the northeast United States bars and twists are usually referred to as crullers Another is the beignet a square shaped doughnut covered with powdered sugar commonly associated with New Orleans Nom kong ន ប ងកង the traditional Cambodian doughnut is named after its shape the word កង pronounced kong in Khmer literally means wheel whilst nom ន ប ង is the general word for pastry or any kind of starchy food A very inexpensive treat for

115 National Doughnut Day celebrates the doughnut s history and role in popular culture There is a race in Staunton Illinois featuring doughnuts called the Tour de Donut In the US especially in Southern California fresh doughnuts sold by the dozen at local doughnut shops are typically packaged in generic pink boxes This phenomenon has been attributed to Ted Ngoy and Ning Yen refugees of the Cambodian genocide who began to transform the local doughnut shop industry in 1976 They proved so adept at the business and in training fellow Chinese Cambodian refugees to follow suit that these local doughnut shops soon dominated native franchises such as Winchell s Donuts Ngoy and Yen allegedly planned to purchase boxes of a lucky red color rather than the standard white but settled on a leftover pink stock because of its lower cost In the mid 1970s pink doughnut boxes were already a common sight in the eastern and midwestern United States due to the fact that Dunkin Donuts used a solid pink color for its boxes at that time 116 It switched to a different box design sometime after 1975 But the chain did not begin to establish a major presence in California until the 2010s 117 Owing to the success of Ngoy and Yen s business the color soon became a recognizable standard in California Due to the locality of Hollywood the pink boxes frequently appeared as film and television props and were thus transmitted into popular culture 118 National Doughnut Day also known as National Donut Day celebrated in the United States of America is on the first Friday of June each year succeeding the Doughnut Day event created by The Salvation Army in 1938 to honor those of their members who served doughnuts to soldiers during World War I 119 About 250 Salvation Army volunteers went

Adjutant Helen Purviance came up with the idea of providing doughnuts These are reported to have been an instant hit and soon many soldiers were visiting The Salvation Army huts Margaret Sheldon wrote of one busy day Today I made 22 pies 300 doughnuts 700 cups of coffee Soon the women who did this work became known by the servicemen as Doughnut Dollies
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball,Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team s court under organized rules 1 It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964 Beach volleyball was introduced to the program at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball The complete set of rules is extensive 2 but play essentially proceeds as follows a player on one of the teams begins a rally by serving the ball tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm from behind the back boundary line of the court over the net and into the receiving team s court 3 The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court The team may touch the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the court but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively 3 Typically the first two touches are used to set up for an attack An attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally thus losing the point The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally A few of the most common faults include The ball is usually played with the hands or arms but players can legally strike or push short contact the ball with any part of the body 4 A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball including spiking and blocking because those plays are made above the top of the net the vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport as well as passing setting and specialized player positions Offensive and defensive structures are also key plays 5 William G Morgan invented the sport in 1895 while he was the YMCA physical education director in Holyoke Massachusetts 6 Because he originally derived the game from badminton he initially named the sport mintonette 7 He was a one time student of basketball inventor James Naismith and invented the game for his clients at the YMCA most of whom were middle aged businessmen for whom the physical demands of basketball were too great 8 The first rules written down by Morgan called for a net 6 ft 6 in 1 98 m high a 25 ft 50 ft 7 6 m 15 2 m court and any number of players A match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team before sending the ball to the opponents court In case of a serving error a second try was allowed Hitting the ball into the net was considered a foul with loss of the point or a side out except in the case of the first try serve 9 After an observer Alfred Halstead noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896 played at the International YMCA Training School now called Springfield College the game quickly became known as volleyball it was originally spelled as two words volley ball Volleyball rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the game spread around the country to various YMCAs 9 10 In the early 1900s Spalding through its publishing company American Sports Publishing Company produced books with complete instruction and rules for the sport 11 The first official ball used in volleyball is disputed some sources say Spalding created the first official ball in 1896 while others claim it was created in 1900 12 13 14 The rules evolved over time in 1916 in the Philippines the skill and power of the set and spike had been introduced and four years later a three hits rule and a rule against hitting from the back row were established In 1917 the game was changed from requiring 21 points to win to a smaller 15 points to win In 1919 about 16 000 volleyballs were distributed by the American Expeditionary Forces to their troops and allies which sparked the growth of volleyball in new countries 12 Like basketball volleyball spread quickly due to its simplicity and promotion by the YMCA and YWCA 8 The first country outside the United States to adopt volleyball was Canada in 1900 12 During and after World War I the presence of YMCA instructors in American forces led to the spread of volleyball in Europe where clubs were established in France as well as several Soviet nations 8 An international federation the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball FIVB was founded in 1947 and the first World Championships were held in 1949 for men and 1952 for women 15 The sport is now popular in Brazil in Europe where especially Italy the Netherlands and Eastern Europe have been major forces since the late 1980s in Russia in other countries including China and the rest of Asia and in the United States 10 9 15 Beach volleyball a variation of the game played on sand and with only two players per team became a FIVB endorsed variation in 1987 and was added to the Olympic program at the 1996 Summer Olympics 12 15 Created by William G Morgan in 1895 beach volleyball is a game of volleyball played by two teams of two players on an outdoor sandy court 16 Volleyball is also a sport at the Paralympics managed by World ParaVolley 17 Nudists were early adopters of the game with regular organized play in clubs as early as the late 1920s 18 19 By the 1960s a volleyball court had become standard in almost all nudist naturist clubs 20 Recently a debate has arisen within the sport regarding the inclusion of transgender players With transgender athletes including Tiffany Abreu joining professional volleyball teams alongside other non transgender teammates many professionals sports analysts and fans of volleyball either express concerns about the legitimacy and fairness of having transgender players on a team or convey support for the transgender players 21 Volleyball has been part of the Summer Olympics program for both men and women consistently since 1964 A volleyball court is 9 m 18 m 29 5 ft 59 1 ft divided into equal square halves by a net with a width of one meter 39 4 in 22 The top of the net is 2 43 m 7 ft 11 11 16 in above the center of the court for men s competition and 2 24 m 7 ft 4 3 16 in for women s competition varied for veterans and junior competitions 3 Typically in beach volleyball there is a playing area and a free zone area The dimensions are 52 6 x 26 3 including the free zone and a minimum of 9 10 wide The court includes 3 lines net line side line and end line In Beach volleyball scoring is similar to regular volleyball 3 matches are being played The minimum height clearance for indoor volleyball courts is 7 m 23 0 ft although a clearance of 8 m 26 2 ft is recommended 22 A line 3 m 9 8 ft from and parallel to the net is considered the attack line This 3 meter or 10 foot line divides the court into back row and front row areas and the back court and front court 22 These are in turn divided into 3 areas each these are numbered as follows starting from area 1 which is the position of the serving player After a team gains the serve also known as siding out its members must rotate in a clockwise direction with the player previously in area 2 moving to area 1 and so on with the player from area 1 moving to area 6 3 Each player rotates only one time after the team gains possession of the service the next time each player rotates will be after the other team wins possession of the ball and loses the point 22 The team courts are surrounded by an area called the free zone which is at least 3 meters wide and may be entered and played within by the players after the service of the ball 23 All lines marking the boundaries of the team court and the attack zone are drawn or painted within the dimensions of the area and are therefore part of the court or zone If a ball touches a line it is considered in An antenna is placed on each side of the net perpendicular to the sideline serving as a vertical extension of the side boundary of the court A ball passing over the net must pass completely between the antennae or their theoretical extensions to the ceiling without contacting them 3 FIVB regulations state that the ball must be spherical made of leather or synthetic leather have a circumference of 65 67 cm 26 26 in a weight of 260 280 g 9 2 9 9 oz and an interior air pressure of 0 30 0 325 kg cm2 4 26 to 4 61 psi 294 3 to 318 82 mbar or hPa 24 Other governing bodies have similar regulations Each team consists of six players 22 To get play started a team is chosen to serve by coin toss A player from the serving team throws the ball into the air and attempts to hit the ball so it passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team s court the serve 22 The opposing team must use a combination of no more than three contacts with the volleyball to return the ball to the opponent s side of the net 22 These contacts usually consist first of the bump or pass so that the ball s trajectory is aimed towards the player designated as the setter second of the set usually an over hand pass using wrists to push finger tips at the ball by the setter so that the ball s trajectory is aimed towards a spot where one of the players designated as an attacker can hit it and third by the attacker who spikes jumping raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent s court to return the ball over the net 3 The team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on offence The team on defence attempts to prevent the attacker from directing the ball into their court players at the net jump and reach above the top and if possible across the plane of the net to block the attacked ball 3 If the ball is hit around above or through the block the defensive players arranged in the rest of the court attempt to control the ball with a dig usually a fore arm pass of a hard driven ball After a successful dig the team transitions to offence The game continues in this manner rallying back and forth until the ball touches the court within the boundaries or until an error is made 22 The most frequent errors that are made are either to fail to return the ball over the net within the allowed three touches or to cause the ball to land outside the court 22 A ball is in if any part of it touches the inside of a team s court or a sideline or end line and a strong spike may compress the ball enough when it lands that a ball which at first appears to be going out may instead be in Players may travel well outside the court to play a ball that has gone over a sideline or end line in the air A standard competitive volleyball match is played in a best of five sets format and typically goes on for about 90 minutes 25 Other common errors include a player touching the ball twice in succession a player catching the ball a player touching the net while attempting to play the ball or a player penetrating under the net into the opponent s court There are a large number of other errors specified in the rules although most of them are infrequent occurrences These errors include back row or libero players spiking the ball or blocking back row players may spike the ball if they jump from behind the attack line players not being in the correct position when the ball is served attacking the serve in the front court and above the height of the net using another player as a source of support to reach the ball stepping over the back boundary line when serving taking more than 8 seconds to serve 26 or playing the ball when it is above the opponent s court A point is scored when the ball contacts the floor within the court boundaries or when an error is made when the ball strikes one team s side of the court the other team gains a point and when an error is made the team that did not make the error is awarded a point in either case paying no regard to whether they served the ball or not If any part of the ball hits the line the ball is counted as in the court The team that won the point serves for the next point If the team which won the point served in the previous point the same player serves again If the team that won the point did not serve the previous point the players of the team acquiring the serve rotate their position on the court in a clockwise manner The game continues with the first team to score 25 points by a two point margin awarded the set Matches are best of five sets and the fifth set if necessary is usually played to 15 points Scoring differs between leagues tournaments and levels high schools sometimes play best of three to 25 in the NCAA matches are played best of five to 25 as of the 2008 season 27 Before 1999 points could be scored only when a team had the serve side out scoring and all sets went up to only 15 points The FIVB changed the rules in 1999 with the changes being compulsory in 2000 to use the current scoring system formerly known as rally point system primarily to make the length of the match more predictable and to make the game more spectator and television friendly The final year of side out scoring at the NCAA Division I Women s Volleyball Championship was 2000 Rally point scoring debuted in 2001 28 and games were played to 30 points through 2007 For the 2008 season games were renamed sets and reduced to 25 points to win Most high schools in the U S changed to rally scoring in 2003 29 30 31 and several states implemented it the previous year on an experimental basis 32 The libero player was introduced internationally in 1998 33 and made its debut for NCAA competition in 2002 34 The libero is a player specialized in defensive skills the libero must wear a contrasting jersey color from their teammates and cannot block or attack the ball when it is entirely above net height When the ball is not in play the libero can replace any back row player without prior notice to the officials This replacement does not count against the substitution limit each team is allowed per set although the libero may be replaced only by the player whom he or she replaced Most U S high schools added the libero position from 2003 to 2005 30 35 The modern day libero often takes on the role of a second setter When the setter digs the ball the libero is typically responsible for the second ball and sets to the front row attacker The libero may function as a setter only under certain restrictions To make an overhand set the libero must be standing behind and not stepping on the 3 meter line otherwise the ball cannot be attacked above the net in front of the 3 meter line An underhand pass is allowed from any part of the court The libero is generally the most skilled defensive player on the team Additionally there is a libero tracking sheet where the referees or officiating team keep track of whom the libero substitutes in and out for Under FIVB rules a libero is not allowed to serve By contrast a libero can serve in NCAA volleyball but only in a specific rotation That is the libero can only serve for one person not for all of the people for whom he or she goes in That rule change was implemented in 2004 and applied to high school and junior high play soon after Under FIVB rules each team can designate two liberos at the beginning of play only one of whom can be on the court at any time and each libero can serve in one specific rotation This rule was implemented in NCAA women s volleyball effective with the fall 2024 season 36 Rule changes enacted in 2000 include allowing serves in which the ball touches the net as long as it goes over the net into the opponents court Also the service area was expanded to allow players to serve from anywhere behind the end line but still within the theoretical extension of the sidelines Other changes were made to lighten up calls on faults for carries and double touches such as allowing multiple contacts by a single player double hits on a team s first contact provided that they are a part of a single play on the ball 37 In 2008 the NCAA changed the minimum number of points needed to win any of the first four sets from 30 to 25 for women s volleyball men s volleyball remained at 30 for another three years switching to 25 in 2011 If a fifth deciding set is reached the minimum required score remains at 15 In addition the word game is now referred to as set 27 The Official Volleyball Rules are prepared and updated every few years by the FIVB s Rules of the Game and Refereeing Commission 38 The latest edition is usually available on the FIVB s website 39 Competitive teams master six basic skills serve pass set attack block and dig 3 Each of the skills consists of a number of specific techniques which have been introduced over the years and are now considered standard practice in high level volleyball A player stands behind the inline and serves the ball in an attempt to drive it into the opponent s court The main objective is to make it land inside the court it is also desirable to set the ball s direction speed and acceleration so that it becomes difficult for the receiver to handle it properly 3 A serve is called an ace when the ball either lands directly onto the opponent s court or the first opponent to touch the ball is unable to volley it hit it upwards enough for a teammate to continue In contemporary volleyball many types of serves are employed Also called reception the pass is the attempt by a team to properly handle the opponent s serve or any form of attack Proper handling includes not only preventing the ball from touching the court but also making it reach the position where the setter is standing quickly and precisely 3 The skill of passing involves fundamentally two specific techniques underarm pass or bump where the ball touches the inside part of the joined forearms or platform at waistline and overhand pass where it is handled with the fingertips like a set above the head 3 Either are acceptable in professional and beach volleyball however there are much tighter regulations on the overhand pass in beach volleyball When a player passes a ball to their setter it is ideal that the ball has relatively little spin to make it easier for the setter The set is usually the second contact that a team makes with the ball 3 The main goal of setting is to put the ball in the air in such a way that it can be driven by an attack into the opponent s court 3 The setter coordinates the offensive movements of a team and is the player who ultimately decides which player will attack the ball As with passing one can distinguish between an overhand set and a bump set Since the former allows for more control over the speed and direction of the ball the bump is used only when the ball is too low to be properly handled with the fingertips or in beach volleyball where rules regulating overhand setting are more stringent In the case of a set one also refers to a front set or back set indicating whether the ball is passed in the direction the setter is facing or behind them There is also a jump set used when the ball is too close to the net In this case the setter usually jumps off their right foot straight up to avoid going into the net The setter typically stands about two thirds of the way from the left to the right side of the net and faces left the larger portion of the net visible to the setter Sometimes a setter refrains from raising the ball for a teammate to perform an attack and tries to play it directly onto the opponent s court This movement is called a dump 42 This can only be performed when the setter is in the front row otherwise it constitutes an illegal back court attack The most common dumps are to throw the ball behind the setter or in front of the setter to zones 2 and 4 More experienced setters toss the ball into the deep corners or spike the ball on the second hit As with a set or an overhand pass the setter passer must be careful to touch the ball with both hands at the same time 3 If one hand is noticeably late to touch the ball this could result in a less effective set as well as the referee calling a double hit and giving the point to the opposing team The attack also known as the spike is usually the third contact a team makes with the ball 3 The object of attacking is to handle the ball so that it lands on the opponent s court and cannot be defended 3 A player makes a series of steps the approach jumps and swings at the ball Ideally the contact with the ball is made at the apex of the hitter s jump At the moment of contact the hitter s arm is fully extended above their head and slightly forward making the highest possible contact while maintaining the ability to deliver a powerful hit The hitter uses arm swing wrist snap and a rapid forward contraction of the entire body to drive the ball 3 A bounce is a slang term for a very hard loud spike that follows an almost straight trajectory steeply downward into the opponent s court and bounces very high into the air A kill is the slang term for an attack that is not returned by the other team thus resulting in a point Contemporary volleyball comprises a number of attacking techniques 43 Blocking refers to the actions taken by players standing at the net to stop or alter an opponent s attack 3 A block which is aimed at completely stopping an attack thus making the ball remain in the opponent s court is called an offensive block A well executed offensive block is performed by jumping and reaching to penetrate with one s arms and hands over the net and into the opponent s area 3 It requires anticipating the direction the ball will go once the attack takes place 3 It may also require calculating the best footwork to executing the perfect block The jump should be timed so as to intercept the ball s trajectory prior to it crossing over the plane of the net Palms are held deflected downward roughly 45 60 degrees toward the interior of the opponents court A roof is a spectacular offensive block that redirects the power and speed of the attack straight down to the attacker s floor as if the attacker hit the ball into the underside of a peaked house roof By contrast it is called a defensive or soft block if the goal is to control and deflect the hard driven ball up so that it slows down and becomes easier to defend A well executed soft block is performed by jumping and placing one s hands above the net with no penetration into the opponent s court and with the palms up and fingers pointing backwards Blocking is also classified according to the number of players involved Thus there are single or solo double and triple blocks 3 Successful blocking does not always result in a roof and many times does not even touch the ball While it is obvious that a block was a success when the attacker is roofed a block that consistently forces the attacker away from their power or preferred attack into a more easily controlled shot by the defence is also a highly successful block At the same time the block position influences the positions where other defenders place themselves while opponent hitters are spiking Digging is the ability to prevent the ball from touching one s court after a spike or attack particularly a ball that is nearly touching the ground 3 In many aspects this skill is similar to passing or bumping overhand dig and bump are also used to distinguish between defensive actions taken with fingertips or with joined arms 3 It varies from passing however in that it is a much more reflex based skill especially at the higher levels It is especially important while digging for players to stay on their toes several players choose to employ a split step to make sure they are ready to move in any direction Some specific techniques are more common in digging than in passing A player may sometimes perform a dive i e throw their body in the air with a forward movement in an attempt to save the ball and land on their chest When the player also slides their hand under a ball which is almost touching the court it is called a pancake The pancake is frequently used in indoor volleyball but rarely if ever in beach volleyball because the uneven and yielding nature of the sand court limits the chances that the ball will make good clean contact with the hand When used correctly it is one of the more spectacular defensive volleyball plays Sometimes a player may also be forced to drop their body quickly to the floor to save the ball In this situation the player makes use of a specific rolling technique to minimize the chances of injuries Volleyball is essentially a game of transition from one of the above skills to the next with choreographed team movement between plays on the ball The team s movements are determined by the teams chosen serve receive system offensive system coverage system and defensive system The serve receive system is the formation used by the receiving team to attempt to pass the ball to the designated setter Systems can consist of 5 receivers 4 receivers 3 receivers and in some cases 2 receivers The most popular formation at higher levels is a 3 receiver formation consisting of two left sides and a libero receiving every rotation This allows middles and right sides to become more specialized at hitting and blocking Offensive systems are the formations used by the offence to attempt to ground the ball into the opposing court or otherwise score points Formations often include designated player positions with skill specialization see Player specialization below Popular formations include the 4 2 6 2 and 5 1 systems see Formations below There are also several different attacking schemes teams can use to keep the opposing defence off balance Coverage systems are the formations used by the offence to protect their court in the case of a blocked attack Executed by the 5 offensive players not directly attacking the ball players move to assigned positions around the attacker to dig up any ball that deflects off the block back into their own court Popular formations include the 2 3 system and the 1 2 2 system In lieu of a system some teams just use a random coverage with the players nearest the hitter Defensive systems are formations used by the defense to prevent the ball from being grounded in their court by the opposing team These systems outline which players are responsible for specific areas of the court depending on where the opposing team is attacking from Popular systems include the 6 Up 6 Back Deep and 6 Back Slide defenses Teams can also employ various blocking schemes to disrupt the opposing team s offense When one player is ready to serve some teams line up their other five players in a screen to obscure the receiving team s view This action is only illegal if the server uses the screen so the call is left to the referee s discretion based on the screen s impact on the receiving team s ability to pass the ball The most common screening style involves a W formation designed to take up as much horizontal space as possible There are five positions filled on every volleyball team at the elite level setter outside hitter left side hitter middle hitter middle blocker opposite hitter right side hitter and libero defensive specialist Each of the positions plays a specific key role in winning a volleyball match At some levels where substitutions are unlimited teams will make use of a defensive specialist in place of or in addition to a libero This position does not have unique rules like the libero position instead these players are used to substitute out a poor back row defender using regular substitution rules A defensive specialist is often used if you have a particularly poor back court defender in right side or left side but your team is already using a libero to take out your middles Most often the situation involves a team using a right side player with a big block who must be subbed out in the back row because they are not able to effectively play backcourt defence Similarly teams might use a serving specialist to sub out a poor server The three standard volleyball formations are known as 4 2 6 2 and 5 1 which refers to the number of hitters and setters respectively 4 2 is a basic formation used only in beginners play while 5 1 is by far the most common formation in high level play The 4 2 formation has four hitters and two setters The setters usually set from the middle front or right front position The team will therefore have two front row attackers at all times In the international 4 2 the setters set from the right front position The international 4 2 translates more easily into other forms of offence The setters line up opposite each other in the rotation The typical lineup has two outside hitters By aligning like positions opposite themselves in the rotation there will always be one of each position in the front and back rows After service the players in the front row move into their assigned positions so that the setter is always in the middle front Alternatively the setter moves into the right front and has both a middle and an outside attacker the disadvantage here lies in the lack of an offside hitter allowing one of the other team s blockers to cheat in on a middle block The clear disadvantage with this offensive formation is that there are only two attackers leaving a team with fewer offensive weapons Another aspect is to see the setter as an attacking force albeit a weakened force because when the setter is in the frontcourt they are able to tip or dump so when the ball is close to the net on the second touch the setter may opt to hit the ball over with one hand This means that the blocker who would otherwise not have to block the setter is engaged and may allow one of the hitters to have an easier attack In the 6 2 formation a player always comes forward from the back row to set The three front row players are all in attacking positions As a result all six players act as hitters at one time or another while two can act as setters So the 6 2 formation is now a 4 2 system but the back row setter penetrates to set The 6 2 lineup thus requires two setters who line up opposite to each other in the rotation In addition to the setters a typical lineup will have two middle hitters and two outside hitters By aligning like positions opposite themselves in the rotation there will always be one of each position in the front and back rows After service the players in the front row move into their assigned positions The advantage of the 6 2 is that there are always three front row hitters available maximizing the offensive possibilities However not only does the 6 2 require a team to possess two people capable of performing the highly specialized role of setter it also requires both of those players to be effective offensive hitters when not in the setter position At the international level only the Cuban National Women s Team employs this kind of formation It is also used by NCAA teams in Division III men s play and women s play in all divisions partially due to the variant rules used which allow more substitutions per set than the 6 allowed in the standard rules 12 in matches involving two Division III men s teams 46 and 15 for all women s play 47 The 5 1 formation has only one player who assumes setting responsibilities regardless of their position in the rotation The team will therefore have three front row attackers when the setter is in the back row and only two when the setter is in the front row for a total of five possible attackers The player opposite the setter in a 5 1 rotation is called the opposite hitter In general opposite hitters do not pass they stand behind their teammates when the opponent is serving The opposite hitter may be used as a third attack option back row attack when the setter is in the front row this is the normal option used to increase the attack capabilities of modern volleyball teams Normally the opposite hitter is the most technically skilled hitter of the team Back row attacks generally come from the back right position known as zone 1 but are increasingly performed from back centre in high level play The big advantage of the system is that the setter always has 3 hitters with which to vary sets If the setter performs well the opponent s middle blocker may not have enough time to block with the outside blocker increasing the chance for the attacking team to make a point There is another advantage the same as that of a 4 2 formation as a front row player the setter is allowed to jump and dump the ball onto the opponent s side Thus the setter can confuse the opponent s blocking players they have the option to jump and dump or set to one of the hitters A good setter knows and they are able to jump to dump or to set for a quick hit as well as when setting outside thus they are able to confuse the opponent The 5 1 offence is a mix of 6 2 and 4 2 when the setter is in the front row the offense looks like a 4 2 when the setter is in the back row the offense looks like a 6 2 There are many variations on the basic rules of volleyball By far the most popular of these is beach volleyball which is played on sand with two people per team and rivals the main sport in popularity Some games related to volleyball include
